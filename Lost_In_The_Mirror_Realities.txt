Lost In The Mirror Realities.  


We were all there. We were all not there.
We all fought as one. We all fought with one.
We entered a group. We left a group.
We are back there. We are right there.

Not in the mirrored realities. 
There is not reality for thee.
For there is nothing you see.
If you see then you should feel.

I entered here. I left here.
I battled with all. I battled against all.
I entered a group. I left a group.
I am right here. I am right here.

Not in the mirrored realities. 
There is not reality for thee.
For there is nothing you see.
If you see then you should feel.

You go now. You leave now.
You will find fear. You will fight fear.
You may group. You are a group.
You are near. You are near.

Not in the mirrored realities. 
There is not reality for thee.
For there is nothing you see.
If you see then you should feel.

You should fear. I could fear.
You fight you. ]I fight you.
You and I. You or I.
You could die. I could die.
