The door closes in Guile's room, sits against the door and reads the contract.

Guile reads, ,,Any and contents of this document may not be viewed by the deliverables or person not bound by the contract.'' 

Guile looks over the contract. He folds the contract and stuffs the contract into an pocket on the inside of Branching armor. He stands, steps and lays on bed.

Guile sleeps.
