>You, kill, William and you be with me. You need to be more than a warrior. You need to be an actor that shows who you are...You being the water to the glass room...You go to Warriors waiting and bring Tom and the hairy twins. ...You see the new warriors to submission...You see the time as wax along the coast...You attend to the warriors needs else you are no longer responisble beyond cleaning their rooms...You see to kill Spear or Kirra...You wake, Guile. Eyees open to let the mind see all that be around. Guile, you wake. Guile, you need to control the thoughts of they will overwhelm your mind. The surface talk of the mind trust will create a darknees. The mind trust will overwhelm a sane mind if that mind allows it to be controlled by the thoughts of all,< sees to Guile's.

The surface words like many voices with only one talking loud and one whispering. The voices come to Guile from the space of dark.

>Go. You go and see...< sees a rough voice with words ending in clicks.

>You have no time to go through the...< sees a soft faint whispering voice louder than the rest in Guile's mind.

A gruff mental voice shout, >YOU, GLICK, GO HELP JOHN!<

>You are no longer of you won mind. Free is an option go and find the way to get beyond the free of the body, and you may find your true mind...< says a soothing voice that fades to silence.

Guile opens eyes.

Bright white become dim.

Guile look above...

Asihlouette blob move along the ceiling. The sihlouette blop spreads and become like a body laying above.

Guile peers...

A person in the sihlouette through the glass walls.

The light above dims like light from dusk.

Guile sits. 

A dark sihlouette like a human or elf stands against the glass. Guile looks left then right.

To the left, Guile sees a sihlouette of a chair and desk.

To the right, Guile sees two sihlouttes move gainst the glass wall the shrink.

<Where is the light? How is the sihlouette? If the light?>

Love see to Guile, >YOu see to all.<

>Where?< sees Guile. 

A smooth voice that endds with clicks sees, >YOu will need to think in complete thought if we are to see what is<

Guile's head beats with heat. 

>What...Where am I< sees Guile.

I quiet voice says, >You are in your room.<

>Room?< sees Guile. >What?<

>YOU NEED TO THINK IN A COMPLETE THOUGHT?< shouts a gruff voice.

Guile squints against the pain breaking through head from the scream. >What room am I in?<

The quiet voice sees, >You in our room.<

Guile looks down and sees a sihlouette from above of a being pacing below. <|Where am I?> thinks Guile.

>YOU SEE TO ALL!< sees a cracking voice. 

Tones singing sounds of surface talk words and sees, >We see loud when we see to the other. We feel distracted when you see to no other. We will see your thought more. You internal thoughts make our minds sore.<

Guile looks the shadow in the corner. He squints at the shadow.

A warm voice flows through mind. >...We have people at the fights...<

The shadow sees to be his a satchel, the branching armor folded nest to the folded Rope of Rieghn. 

A fast and strong voice sees, >WeLoseThisFightToStopTheFighterAndGiveUsAMindBoostWhileWeCasteThePain...<

He looks at arms and body.

With a voice that flows like water through a wriver to the fore of the mind. >You let us see the rage and the pain, and we will be to see for all the we...< and the voice fades.

A white silk shirt and pants with gold threat hangs over clean olive skin.

>You have a bright white sheets that are from silk from Tallen,< sees a voice in Guile's mind. 

Then there is silens as Guile stares.

His fingers and hands are clean and skin is smooth.  Fumes of cherry rise.

Guile breathes and feels mint blow from nose and mouth. His tongue licks smooth teeth.

A mental voice chatters. >We need to eat. We have out time. We will go.

<Food,> thinks Guile then he sees, >where is food?<

A flow of voices flow loud and quiet. >We have a sun burn as deep as the depts of the city...We will eat the bread...You will need to follow the lights and step into the brightest wall...The wall with a sihloutte leads to a lift-up...We have a fighter that died. We have his thoughts...You want to feel the pain?<

He sees a through of an open plan flow to a cave free of...

Guild squeezes temples. He stands. He pounds foot on floor and feels no pain. His stomach bubbles and drops. He walks to the wall with no sihloutte. He squints.

All goes white.

Guile feels to lift. 

A blurr of shadows flow past.

A dark circle hangs above.             

Guile feels his gut fall. He reaches up to touche the the glass.

The dark circle rises to past the sihlouette adn throug hthe light then stops.

Guile stands.

Sihlouettes before cover teh walls around. 

The mall dark cicle below Guile's feet rises. 

The dark circle above disappears.

Guile rises.

Surface thoughts with a hint clicks and clack shove through Guile's mind, >We eat...We go. You go...We run through...Fight begins...Free...It is Spear...We have done...All...You eat for all...You move...And you seen it all...Read the instructions for...Shadow warrior follows...the song heals at night...You see the planges...You move...You move...You move...<

Guile stands and stares around at silence.An open room glass room three heights of Guild and as far as Guile can see spans around. Open space spans around Guile with people rising from the floor, crouching to grab a disk at their feet while walking from the open space to a wall of people stand by raises tabels and chairs.

Id, humans, dwarves, haflings and elves stand with many goblinkin. All wear cliths the shades of white. Purple and gold and yellow embrodiery  twist adn twirl along the cuffs.

Guile peeps at a few passing people.

By the human wall a dark wall covers. Ropes hang from the wall and hold sqauar, circle and triangle lights. Carts pushed by gray dressed beings steam with plates and platers on top.

The people stnding around tables grab plates and glasses from the pushed trays while another gray robed pile dirty dishes on the cart.

A few people cough. The coughs spread to silence.

>You move from the portal,< sees a voice through Guile.

>You like the mead...All that is beyond our scope and field. The process...All the fights you see...You have left...You see good,< Guile sees in mind.

Guile feels fumes of mint cools sing, taste of berries sour, flow of ale dizzy.

Guile sees the plane, and the voice quiet to a wind whisper, and Guile steps.

>|You step from portal and grab your circle.< see the samve mental voice.

Guile steps from the circle, touches teh circle. 

A circles disk of glass flow tetters up and down.

Guile grabs the disk and steps back.

A hugoblin wearing blue silk robe with green lines around the cuffs and bottom. The hugoblin's height stands a head above Guile and steps away from Guile. 

I clicking voice flows to surface talk. >YOu need to move from the path if you are going to be with we. We are...<

Guiles thinks of the planes and paths. 

The voice become wind, and the wind blows away between the people walks to and from the crowd of people along the edige of the open space.

Two people put down disks over a hole, steps on disk and lower through the tube.

Guile walks to the edge.

People sit and stares across tables. 

Beyond the tabels

He holds his disk as he walks to the people standing around windows. He walks as the hugoblin wearing blue.

The hugoblins walks. A wind blowing voice sees, >You need to move for it is some time for food.<

Guile looks from the hugoblins walking away. He looks around at the people. >Where?< Guile sees to all. >Where is this place. What is this place?<

Shouts and whspers see as one. >YOU I no Yes and with fun eat WE we We LIQUID Near surface Hill GO GO You We...< 

Guile looks at the hugoblin and follows step.

A calm mono tone voice sees. >We are in the quartes of the mind hive. We are a mind of worker bugs for our queen and king.< The hugoblins looks back and smile at Guile then looks forward and walks to the people standing along an unseen edge. >|You are here to eat. We eat here.<

The voice in mind echo and talk, >HERE Jump. Try for it...NOW WE we YOU tastes like...No yes right.<

A hugoiblin rises next to Guile as Guile walks past.

Guile steps back.

The hugoblin with sheer yellow cotton robes steps her near named body away from Guile. The goblins round and soft features round and narrow around her hips to legs and body. 

Guile looks to the ground.

>Love Right...Lost. No you don't have. We... Us - NOW! It all will be FOR FOR...< And the noise fades from mind as Guile sees to the ground.

Guile stares at the flat glass floor. 

Two holes, like two circle in the floor flow down. Pairs of circle holes spread over the glass ground every six wides steps. The holes are both the same size about Guile's width of spear with both arms extended likea cross. 

A sihloueet far below becomes dot through one hole. A sihloutte grows through other then stops growing and flows into the light from the tube of light.

He lays the wide glass sheet on ground.

Guile kneels and looks at the hole. He puts his had ovee the hole and feels a force pushe his hand up. He rests his hand over the hole nearby, and he feels his hand lower with a force holding and guiding down.

Gulie pulls arm back.

Voices whisper like wind through a canyon of Guile's mind.

A human wearing blue cotton pants and a shirt hanging to waist steps by Guile, steps to a hole and slowly floats down.

The voice become mumbles sounds beyond the sound of hearing meaning. 

Guile slides the glass to the hole.

The glass floats.

Guile pulls the glass to the other hole.

The glass floats down.

Guile things to self. <Why glass there?> He reaches for the glass plate and his hand flows through it.

LovteKitLkoi sees into Guile's mind, >You will find the tubes will lift or lower an object. YOu see the place for food and drink. You will find bathes and bowls for waste below. Cloths diry will be lower through the tubes.<

Guile stands. 

The whisper voice in mind shout after Love's is silent. >YOU. WE. RIGHT NOW,< then speak to calm confusing gibberish. >|Sat, Rill. On. It thoought. You you we had then for next red glass tall all now you we had no you of...<

Then LovteKitLkoi mental voice conforms the surface words to her purr. >You lifted your being as you lift other being through the tubes. We create the force to move as we think open. You have the power to control the physical as others around. We focus the force to help lift as we show you your own mind and our mind.<

Guile walks by holes and a few being rising from holes to walk. 

>You will find your mind will hear and see things beyond you abilitys. You will hearing the whispers of thought and begin to see and feel sights beyond the minds.<

Guile sees to all, >Where can I go? Where can we go?<

The whispers flow and sound throug mind.

Love voice speaks. >You go up or down or in a room. You will eave the hive when your mind can see with-<

Guile's foot slips and falls. Guile falls and slaps palm against the floor as his foot hangs. He sniffs and coughts.

>Guile,< sees Love. >You may release. We have you with your own thoughts.<

Guile raises hands and floats.

>YOu control the direction as you walk. We support the motion. You will find you place,< sees Love as her voice purrs to quiet with the sound of mumbling surface talk through the dark and over hte plane in Guile's mind.

Over the plane of glass and holes spreads before Guile.

Fumes of fried fat and fuming sage and mustard float.

Guile sneezes.

Heads turn. Eyelid blink, and eyes stare for a few blinks. Then a stare spreads over the faces. The faces relaxe and settle forward.

Mouths slowly chew food and arm raise food slow and steady to mouths.

A few smile and laugh. Their face brighten then relax and stare.

Guile steps to the people.

People are dressed in shirt and pants and robes. Silk and cotten weaves hang loos over creatures.

The people eat friuts, meats and breads from glass plates. The drink red, clear and brown liquids from glass cups. They stand and sit with eyes closed, starring forward. Some face smile and blush while other sit still and staire throug the person before them. 

Guile walks between tables and people to a line. >Is this line for food?< sees Guile.

The flow of mummblin voices sees, >No,< then one soft smooth voice says, >You stand in the line for liquid. We have a line for solids along the wall.

Guile waits in the line thinking of planes watching the people

People step

The sounds of Guile's foots steps tap as loud as the calm of the mumbling inf Guile's mind. Guile sees, >How many people are controlled by Senator Ring?< sees Guile

The mumbling voice becomes laughter then talk and mumbles as one noise.

A crackling smoke voice flows. >We control all and none.<

>How many are we? Are we all controlled by Love? Why can't we leave?< Guile sees as he steps froward in line.

A halfling steps past with two glases. One ith red liqued and the other with clear liquid.

The crakling voice sees. >We are a small army through the city of Gnomse and the desert beyond. We are controlled by us and guided by Senator Ring and his sixteen masters. You can see to leave when you can see with all.<

>Who are you?< sees Guile. He looks aover shoulders and steps forward in line.

People stands, walks and stare. No beings look at Guile.

>I am Hinu,< sees the crackling mental voice of Hinu.

>Where are you?< sees Guile. He steps foward in line.

>Hinu is in the cube of rooms resting and seeing through the thoughts and the minds,< see Hinu.

>You are far from body,< sees Guile. He sees through the window in the gglass wall.

The widnow spans an arms width.

Hinus voice pops. >Hinu is close to the minds and through the mind Hinu sees..<

An elf wearing a wool skirt and coat steps from the window holding a glass chalice and a glass mug with clear liquids.

Hinu's voice flows while Guile steps forward. >|With no effort to see with you for Hinu seeks.<

Hinu's voice is stopped when a loud voice in Guile's mind screams. >You want what?<

Guile hears hinu's mental voice against. >...And you I found.<

Guile stands. He looks around. He sweats. He clears through.

An id through the window raises four arms and presses palms against the glass wall.

>You want to drink?< sees a voice to Guile.

Guile feels pressure through his head. His hand tingles. 

<Water,> thinks Guile. >I want water,< he sees.

The id grabs a glass and hold below the blurred window of the counter. He sets a glass cup on the coutner.

Guile grabs the water and walks. He drinks.

A murmur of thought speaks through Guile's mind. >...Then we run through the halls and hit the wall. ...We will see if the warriors will give us their... JOINIT WILL SEE WHAT SEEN! ...It's time to come as one and conguer the greater house. ...Where are we.<

Guile's walk becomes a stand. Gile focuses on the faint voice talking about the great house through the murmur like talking through a plane of threats. He each thread flowing around creating the sky and the ground of sound. Guile feels to the voice and hears in mind. >|...Senator Ring is seeing to small our place in this city for there be no other tha will win. We will return from the desert while the fog of war will stop the leader and the senate from controlling our lands-<

A dwarf bumps into Guile.

Guile drops the glass. 

The glass shatters. 

All thought leaves Guile's mind.

People stare.

Guile steps from glass and looks back at the id. 

The id, a stones throw away, looks with everyone else at Guile.

Guile kneels and pickup a chunk of glass.

The id's deep mental voice says, >You leave for the gray sheets.<

The dwarf that bumped into Guiles sees, >You half-breed standing around...< the mental voice trails and fades to the murmur as the dwarf steps away.

Guile stands and steps around the glass. He looks back at the id and walks away.

People glance at Guile then stare away as they eat, walk, and stare away. People step around the broken glass. 

Guile walks smell fuming under mount lamb. 

The murmur calms through Guile's minds. Guile feels for the faint voice through murmrurs.

Sounds shout in mind, >|GLASS, FEAR...Running through the halls. FIGHT. Help me find this. ...<

Guile thinks of plane of threads and sees to all. >What do I do, Love?< His voice leave own mind and flows to silecne. Guile walks along the galss wall by a few lines.

The lines lead to windows with foods. A line for meat, a line for fruit and line for vegetables streatch between a path betweeen the walls and tables.

Guile looks at a tall skinny elf with tone legs leading to muscle cut thights and a toga. His tan chest flexes along shoulders, neck and narrow face and olive shaped brown eyes. >Who you?< sees Guile.

The olive sized eyes glance at Guile as the body pass past Guile. A snooty surface talk flows into Guile's mind, >You have seen with Lantic Realm from the Rise and away to the Set.<

Gulie stops and looks back, >What do I do?<

>You walk,< the elf says.

>Why?< sees Guile.

>I do not understand you short thoughts of your own mind. You have to be...< the voice fades to the murmur, and the murmur rises in wave volumes rolling in mind. >YOu FIGHT. Now, we go. Have not time to... RUN. IT IS NOT RIGHT! Don't see if you want. ...All the time I wnt wht you- HERE! HERE! IN THE PIT KILE NOW, William. Kill now.<

Guile stands and focuses on the purring voice of Love. 
 
Love sees, >...You kill now William then you be.< A purr flows from the murmur.

Guile sees and feels the purr. 

Love sees, >|Hello, Gulie. You have found my mind though by body be far, so you see the hive of our minds spaning...< Love's voice fades with a purr and the rise of the murmur to, >MOVE. MOVE NOW.<

Guile blinks.

A few pople step around. A line eight people long spans from a window and fumes of frying fat and bread. 

Guile's stomach bubbles rumbles. Body feels to float and sway. He looks back.

Gulie stands in line and steps fillling a wide space between him and the next person in line.  >Food,< Guile sees.

A quick voice sees. >|You want food then remain in line to eat.< 

Guile looks around. The mumrur waves in screams and moans. 

A human lifts a dark hand at Guile's face.

Gulies stepa back and bumbs a short being, a gnome, next in line to the window.

The gname sees a blast of noise, >|YOUSTEPAWAYFROMMEGUILE.< The gnomse steps away.

The mental noise stuns Guile. 

Guile shakes head and sees to all. >I, sorry, I, Guile, standing behind you, bumped you.<

The gnome steps to the window and grabs a tray with a steaming bowl and a fuming bread.

Guile follows the gnome. >You are. Who are you gnome that I follows. Can I see your thoughts in my murmur? What are we doing? Why are we hear.<

The murmurs of thought flow thought Guile then the loud broken surface talk voice. >You are not the food to eat. You are new. I don't have time for new.<

The voice fades to the murmurs. 

Guile hears for the murmurs with thoughts of sound flows through all the mental noise. >We. Hill and up...Run of the edge...Where...< Guile hears and feels the mental voice and focuses. >Where is...Whhere are you,< sees the strong voice of the gnome. Another voice sees. >Near the water window, I sit.<

The gnomes strong voice sees, >You have seating for another?<

>No,< sees the other mental voice like a woman breathing sex. 

Guile steps after the nose and the fumes of bread. He grabs the flaps of hanging skin from stomach. He walks after the gnome.

The voices talk in Guile's mind as he lets the mental talk and sight see. >You have some bread for water and flip juice,< sees the strong voice. An effeminate voice blows, >You have one behind you.< >I see the being. He is a new being.< >You are following, my friend.< >I only want for a seat as I have been walking through the people today seeing beyond all the minds that roam through the snack and betting area. The warriors are the minds to be seeing.< The female mind voice sees, >The fighting only creates a mad mind. You see the fights and i sees the money of credit flowing through the markets. Who has the better-< >You can go insane watching numbers as was watching thoughts for defeat or injection. You have no mind after a rush of tax collection at the end of the day. You have-< The female mental voices pause.

Guie stands before the gnome holding drink and a male id. The male id holds ball of brown root and looks at the gnome. The gnome sits on the seat.

The gnome sees, >Guile, you find my name through my mind?<

The female voice sees, >He is look at us.<

Giuie sits steps the table. >I, Guile.< Guile points to self. >don't see thoughts of others not see at me through a murmur.<

The soft wind voice sees through Guile and from the murmur. >Guile, you stand next to Flilimilouminatom and Ooooooolij. I am Ooooooolij from the distand lands of the empire

Ooooooolij, the id, sit staight and high from the stool. he raises lower arms and holds open palm above table and before Guile.

Flilimilouminatom drinks water, sees, >You be a noob.<

>Noob,< sees Guile. He glances at the bread. 

the bread steam flows through Guile. 

Flilimilouminatom pull a piece of bread and tosses it at Guile. >You a noob.<

Guile juggles the bread then picks the bread up from table. He eats, sees. >Thanks. ...I thank you for the bread.<

Ooooooolij sweet blowing mind site sees through Guile calming hunger. >How long you been inside the hive?<

>Hive?< Guile swallows. >What hive?<

>All the murmurs in your mind are of the hive,< sees Ooooooolij. Ooooooolij looks above and beyond Guile. >You hear the buzz of Love's nest.<

Guile swallows and looks from Ooooooolij to Flilimilouminatom. >Love's nest is queen bug.< Guile smiles.

Flilimilouminatom sees, >Love reads mind.<

>What wrong with bugs?< sees Guile as he glances at Flilimilouminatom. He reaching fro more bread and some water.

Flilimilouminatom pulls away the plate and cup. >We share thoughts. You get food.<

Ooooooolij laughs and looks down at Guie and Flilimilouminatom. >You stand to eat that rubbish.< She looks beyond Guile. >|A food window to wax and Set from where you sit serves sweet root and dwarven tender horn.<

Guile peers through a group of people to a window with no people standing before. An ogre dressed in wool brown and shaved head stands and looks at people.

>You see the ogre,< sees Ooooooolij. 

Guile nods. >I see ogre in window.<

Flilimilouminatom drinks water, sees, >Guile, Ooooooolij words not question.<

Guile looks to Ooooooolij to Flilimilouminatom to the ogre in window. Guile walks from the pair and to the window.

A group elves and humans waring wool and silk robes of white and brown stand around a big table and stares. A few drink and head.

Fumes of berries and blooms flows from window.

Guile sneeze and sniffs. Guile walks to the ogre.

The ogre twice as wide and tall as Guile grabs a plate and puts a pile of mush on top. It grabs a cub and puts it near plate.

Guile grabs the plates and looks at the ogre. >I, Guile, thank you for food.<

The ogre stares and sniffs, pushes tray. ,,Go.''

Guile grabs the tray. >I thank you for the food.<

The orgre grunts and riases a fists. ,,Leave my mind.'' It puts fist on table. ''Or I bash mind in.''

Guile steps back. ,,I thank you.'' He steps back again and nudges one from the group, who look back.

An elf peers at Guile. A deep voice blows, >You are an impollet smell being that needs to walk away before we make you lose your mind.<

Guile follows the voice into the minds and shouts. 

The elf's hand flinches, hits a cub. Cub falls and spills over elf.

The murmur flows to a shout, >WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...<

Guile seps with plate and to the Ooooooolij and Flilimilouminatom. A shock tense hands and muscles. Guile stumbles. He snorts and coughs, holds plate.

The murmurs become laughter.

Guile looks back at the group and steps and stands between Flilimilouminatom and Oooooooli.

Flilimilouminatom scops some of the pile of mush with fingers and licks the mush from fingers. >You eat good.<

Oooooooli looks through the distand. >YOu will be wrong to begin creating enemies in the hive.<

Guile thinks of a dark cave and says, ,,You wait.''

Oooooool's deep howl from mouth sees to Guile's mind. >We don't see the surface talk for we are of the mind.<

Flilimilouminato chews and nods. >You wait. WE see our thoughts. They see thoughts.< 

Oooooooli sees. >You should create a ripple and not a wave until you have touched all the minds of this swarm of hungry fiends.

Guile scoops pile of mush with finger and licks fingers. >You see thoughts.< Guile pulls fingers from mouth and looks at Oooooooli. >Why we here?<

A wave of laughter raises and echoes through the space of Guile's thoughts. 

Oooooool sees, >We are hear to serve love and each other to live inside this city and maybe beyond. We are part of a network of people that are willing to kill to live, but heal to keep a friend alive. Around you are people that shouldn't be trusted, but trust them you must if you are to succeed beyond this cube, this nest. You find a path and people to remain and leave when you are trusted.<

Guile shovels more mush into mouth tasting the pepper and onion. >You have path.< He looks at Oooooool.

Oooooool remains still and stares. >I work in the markets to see the thoughts of people while they are being sold and traded.<

>You buy things for cheap and sell them for expensive?< sees Guile. He burps and swallows.

>I walk the crowd. Flilimilouminatom speaks surface talks to seller and makes the bargin.< Ooooooolij stares still. >|We leave during light to buy and sell. We go tomany of the markets around the city high and deep seeking to spread our game to the corners.<

Guile burps. >You see their thoughts and read their throughs to Flilimilouminatom. >|Why you not both read mind?<

Flilimilouminatom swallows and sees, >We are not only hive.<

>How many are use?< Guile feels a tick in nose, sneezes. the white mush spreads over table top.

Ooooooolij sighs and stares. The lets eyes look around the rrom. >You will never know the amount of us unless you are Love.<

Guile clears through. >How do I find a path? And why do I need a path to leave. You can read my mind.< He looks at Flilimilouminatom. >|You can read my mind. Love can read my mind.< 

>All can read your mind.< Flilimilouminatom smiles. >|It open and week.<

Ooooooolij stands and begins to walk from Guile and Flilimilouminatom. >You will find the path then find how to hide your mind from us and from the enemies of the hive. You will find more mind are better than one when finding the path, but not all pairbond.< 

Guile looks back as Ooooooolij steps into the open space of people rising and lowering. 

Ooooooolij continues to see to Guile. >You will pair bond if you come upon one you can trust enough to open your mind while you close it to others.<

Guile scoops food into mouth. He feels a tickle span mind the nose. He chews and sneezes. Food sprays.

Mental laughter rises and spread from the group beings. 

Ooooooolij walks on and sees. >|You will find you way or it will find you, but first I would advise you to try to close your mind to those who know how to open it for all.<

Flilimilouminatom puts cub on table and walks away. >You find path.< And he follows Ooooooolij. >|You find self in mind.<

The murmur mumbles thorugh Guile's mind.

Guile licks fingers and walks after Flilimilouminatom. 

>BEHIND YOU,< shouts a gruff voice in Gulie's mind.

Guile turns, pulls Heart Dagger and holds dagger.

A few people staring beyond sight blink and look at Guile then resume their stare beyond.

Laughter fills Guile's mind. 

Guile sees the loughter, follows the echo into point through his field as his sight sees the group near the ogre serviing food. The laughter consumes Guile and spreads and spans.

People starring no where look at Guild. The murmur quiets and calm in the wake of the laughter.

Guile feels the laughter, rage, confusion, fright and hate. He grabs Heart Dagger and feels the deep thump become a low moan and that moan spread through the laughter and mind. 

The elf at the table near the ogre and window falls to the groud like a puppet with string cut. Another, a tall human, grabs her head and screams. The other step away staring, breathing, sweating.

All people run from Guile. A few shout and many click and clack.

Guile hears the moan flow through the plane in mind and quiet the murmur. 

The murmur become screams and shouts then silences as the moan spreds.

Guile follows the moan through the darkness to the need reaches of dark as the sound swirls around and around... His body falls and spreds over the glass fall.

People steps and fall, float and fly down the tubes through the cube. 

A few chairs fall and shatter.

An elf and human near the orgre window lay on ground still.

Guile lays with the moan vibrating through mind then skull and from skull thorugh spine. He body shakes and aches. He sees the people run. He sees the two dead he sees darkness. 

Darkness spread over guile, and guile follows the moan beyond the beat of his heart. Guile sees away from the vibrating pain through bones.

Then the vibration of bones become a purr. The purr become warm and leads Guile away from the moan.

With a jerk and yank, Guile is dragged. 

Light shine.

Guile blinks aways bright light to see the sihlouettes of soldiers.

Soldiers march around Guile. The yellow chain mail sways over their purple leather body armor. They grip short swords and small shields. Two grabs a leg of Guile. They alls step over the glass floor dragging Guild from the room into a hall.

Guile squirms and shakes back and forth and tries to lift head and chest form floor, but is grabbed by the shoulders by two soldiers. 
Guile is lifted. ,,Where you taking-''

A soldiers ace bunch Guile and clicks and clacks. Another says, ,,You quiet.''

The soldiers carrys Guild around spirals stairs down through a narrrow hall, but wood doors into a cube room.

The soldiers march Guile inside, close wood doors, toss Guile on the rug covered floor.

The wool rug spans the floor and ceiling to the edge of the room ten steps wide and long. Four tapestries hang along the wall show clouds and stars.

The soldiers stand. 

And Guile lays. Guile closes his eyes. He shout through mind. He waits for the echo, but hears no mental noise murmur or echo.

Guile rolls on side. ,,Where I?'' He coughs.

A guard kick Guile's stomach.

Guile glance at the hugoblins. He shoots a thought into mind. He feels the guards body. He moves the guard arms.

The guard lifts arm.

>You stop the thought or you die,< sees Love to Guile's mind.

Guile stares and breath.

The guard looks at the swords and looks at Giule and steps away. 

the guards step away from Guild. 

>Where?< sees Guile to all. >Where is this? Why here? What do?<

The wood doors open.

The guaurds step away from Guile forming a path from door to Guile.

Love steps in the room and stands by Guile's head. 

,,Love, you,'' says Guile.

Love stares. >You see with mind,< and Guile goes silent.

the guards click and clack. One by one the walk from the room.

Love stands and stares down at Guile. Sweet sage with cimmon fumes fill room.

Guile sneezes. >They two attacked my mind.<

Love stares. 

Guile sees with his thooughts through Love's mind. Whispers and echoes of distant converssations fill Guile's mind. 

Then a purr warms Guile's aching cold body. 

Guile focuse on Love's body and arms. He feels the her breath leave her mouth. He stares and sees beyond. He feels the purr.

The purr vibrates mind then skull the spin.

The murmurs of Love's mind quiet to only the purr.

Like a sling shot, Guile's sense snaps and slaps into Guile. Sharp pains spreads from spin to hands. His muscles flex.

Love steps from Guile and sees, >You are a talent fool, but a fool.< She paces the room and walks to one of the tapestry and stares.

Guile's arms and and legs bend at joinst.

>|You killed two of the hive. You have sent fear and choas through the mind that needs order.<

Guile's spine bends and legs and arms press aagainst chest and stomach.

>|The two you killed are from families of wealth and power in Tallindrin.<

Guile's body become a fetal ball the presses. His fingers and toes tingle.

>|You were given a chance to live with us. You were give access to the hive mind to find a path.<

The tingle in Guile's fingers and toes spread through arms and legs leaving fingers and toes numb.

>|You are beyond worth to teach disipline to a childish mind that can not control its temper or ego.<

The tingles spreads then become numb. 

>|You are now indebt to the hive for your imbicile actions.<

Guile feels to float as the numb covers body. He sees, >You give no path. You give no help.<

Love steps near Guile's face as he lay side.

>|You will live only if you are to be of use to the hive.< She crouches before Guile. >|You will live without pain only if you do as I say.<

Guile sess, >You give me path. I follow. I will follow path. I will. I will.<

Love stares. 

Guile sees. >I help. I help.<

Love stands and steps around Guile.

With each step of Love, build feel pain spread through his chest, to arms and to legs. His limbs fall limp. And body rolls to its back. 

The robe off Reighn spreads over the ground. 

A throb of pain flows from his head to chest and arms. 

Love steps on the Robe of Reighn. She purrs through Guile's mind, and the purr spread from head to spine to body creating pleasure from the pain. >Guile...You will be given a path far from the hive until your wild mind can be controlled by yourself.< She wipes her boots on the robe of reighn.

>I do anything.< Guile breathes and heaves. He coughs and coughs. >|You show. I do.< He rolls to chest and pushes to a kneel position.

Love sees, >Can you feel, smell or tell if one is a were beast?<

Guile sniffs and swallows. >I smell rats of my pack. We run packs. Our blood has scent.< He grunts to a stands and pulls the robe of Reighn around body then wipes a side thin tufts of hair. He stares at love. 

Love sees, >Do you know how to control a wererat mind and body?<

Guile sniffs and mouth breaths as the nose sweals from the cinnomon. He stares and thinks of the sky and a stare shine and see a path to the light that flows and from the center. The light becomes a tunnel to flow and see..

Love purrs through Guile's mind. >You will not lose mind with a site.< The purr leavs a redisue vibration that stings spine as spine stings body.

Guile's body jolts and the light tunnel becomes light to see Love stands. Guile sees. >Why you want to know?<

Love stares. She looks down at Guile. >Spear has been infecting warriors with wererat.<

>Why?< sees Guile.

Love's purr makes Guile feel to float. >Do you know how to control a wererat mind and body?<

Guile sniffs. He stares.

They statre.

Guile blins, says, ,,Yes.''

Love grabs Guiles face and squeezes cheeks. 

Guile's lips pukes. 

>YOu see complete,< says Love.

>Yes,< sees Guile.>|I control wererats.<

Love pulls back hands. >Is it easy to control wererats?<

>Why is Spear infecting warriors,< sees Guile.

Love sees, >We know you creatures run in packs. We know you follow the strong when the instincs. We know you disease controls form to live. We learned this from Spear and your mind.<

>They follow Spear. The will feel and smell age. He is strong,< sees Guile. >|They will follow.<
