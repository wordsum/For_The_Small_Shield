The ceiling of board and mud brick fall on Myst and William as Myst and William hug and sing. At first a throat hum and a whistle flows and blows from their mouths.

The song sound swirl around their bodies and mud bricks and dust pile around. Guitar string pluck the scale of strings from high to low while the drums.

Their bodies feel to float then sink under the piling rock, sand and boards. 

Then there is darkness and the song of Reighn singing between their minds.

Distant lyrices mummble words that talk and sing to. ,,Thought all in that is for in the main for the pain of without. No thought is here. No body is near to help us hear our song...'' The volume of the lyrices grows as both William and Myst lose their bodies to the feeling of their body.

Their heart beats as one and the mind thought as one is sung. Through a darkness their minds feel to run with joy through a song.

A voice neigther male nor femail, but smooth like silk wraps around William and Myst.

They feels is one. They feel the words. ''You see...To be...To flee...And we will go as a tree for free and theeeeeeeee...'' The words becomes a tone of e then sings a flute and horn blowing around and down deep. The sounds of drums and horns and plucks string play between William and Myst's souls and they hold on to the other under rock and sand.

They stand and hold. They feel the song through the dark. Between William and Myst, the song sings. ''From flesh to stone you have been shown to meld with the element beyond the body. Until you hear the drum and guitar play stop then the stone will fall on top.''

And Willam and Myst the being holds itself as the song plays and stone and sand pile around.
