Guile wipes feet over ground until the blood smear on foot wipes out.

A few clicks echo close.

Along the hall behind two silhouettes walk along the hall.

Guile hopes on the clean foot for ten hops then falls. Robe of Reign sprawls over floor, Carrafee rolls along hall. Knifes slide away.

The silhouettes stop. The clicks echo to silence. Guile grabs, daggers, carrafe, cube, bag, robe for rieghn and runs the hall, down the stairs three halls bellow then long another hall.

His bloody foot prinf fallows the steps away.

A few walls cubes along the hall glowf from room light.

Guile rubs foot against floor to staircase at other side of glass hall. He walks the stares.

A gray passes down the steps.

Guile walkson hall up then walks the hall over to the other stairs thenwalks up the stairs toward his room and the light shining over silhouttes near Flare's room

The light near Flare's room shines bright. A few grays stand near the blood. A few grays stand at the doorway's to their rooms. Murmurs and clacks talk between.

Ritten steps from Flare's room to stand by the starring grays.

Guile walks past a few grays staring along hall and steps in to his room. He shuts door. He pulls off gray suit, Branching Armor. He grabs water jug and gray suit.

Muffled shouts talk through walls. Then feet stomp pound floor. 

Sihlouettes of small swords and shields walk by the wall.

Guile dips gray suit in the water and wipes blood from hands and feet, ankle. Guile thinks of the feeling of the purr. Guile lets that throguh spread over body from mind. 

The purr vibrates and hums to murmurs. The murmurs talk to thoughts. Guile purrs a thought from surface talk to the Mind Trust. >Get me out.<

Love sees, >No. Now silence.<

The purr through guile itches. The purr through mind silences. 

Ritten's loud shout of ,,GUARD.'' speaks through the wall. 

The walls around guile brighten.

The sillouttes in rooms around Guile rise from bed.Guile lays daggers on bed then flaps gray suit flat on bed then throws blanket over the gray robe.

Sihlouttes step and march through hall along the wall. 

Guile lays naked on bed, closes eyes.

Mummbles of muffled talk through wall chat and clack with the thump of Guile's heart.

Guile inhales and holds breath then slowly exhales.

Ritten shouts and walks the halls. ,,GRAYS. THERE IS A KILLER AMOUNG US BEWARE

Guile dips gray suit in the water and wipes blood from hands and feet, ankle. Guile thinks of the feeling of the purr. Guile lets that throguh spread over body from mind. 

The purr vibrates and hums to murmurs. The murmurs talk to thoughts. Guile purrs a thought from surface talk to the Mind Trust. >Get me out.<

Love sees, >No. Now silence.<

The purr through guile itches. The purr through mind silences. 

Ritten's loud shout of ,,GUARD.'' speaks through the wall. 

The walls around guile brighten.

The sillouttes in rooms around Guile rise from bed.Guile lays daggers on bed then flaps gray suit flat on bed then throws blanket over the gray robe.

Sihlouttes step and march through hall along the wall. 

Guile lays naked on bed, closes eyes.

Mummbles of muffled talk through wall chat and clack with the thump of Guile's heart.

Guile inhales and holds breath then slowly exhales.

Ritten shouts and walks the halls. ,,GRAYS. THERE IS A KILLER AMOUNG US BEWARE.''

All the lights around Guile's room shine casting a dim llight through room.Light silhouettes  walking along the glass wall of hall and gather to create a crowd of silhouette

Guile slides dagger unders sheet, looks over floor and walls.

A small blood smear the size of toe spreasd near base of bed.

Click and clacks smack through the solid wall glass and glass door.sihlouettes clear.

Ritten shouts. ''GRAYS, THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER. THERE IS A KILLING. IF YOU KNOW THE KILLER THEN TELL THE UNION. ELSE THE SOLDIERS AND THE UNION OF GRAY WILL BE TALKING TO EVERYONE OF THIS HALL. WE WILL FIND THIS KILLER!''

Guile lays on back and lany hand on sheet covered heart dagger. His penise hangs and balls itch. Dirty finger nails dig through hair an balls sack.

clicks and clack slow an quiet with the whispers of Surface talk.

Guile itches as a march steps through the halls.

The light behind and one above dim. 

The march stomps from the Wane to Wax of Guile. The march stomps with light silhouttes walking through the hall.

Guile lifts head and watches. He lifts his ball-scratching hand and smells.

The march stomp stops as the silhouettes step before Guie's room
 
Guile stares. He lowers hand from face to the heart dagger.

The door to Guile's room open.

Love, wearing brown leather body suit with ties that lace from ankle to wasst to side of chest to shoulder, strides into guile's room.

Warriors with purple studded leather and yellow chain mail stand behind Love. 

The shadows seemm to bend, shift and stretch with out change in light.

Love clicks and clacks and sees to Guile's mind, >Guile, your guide and gray team mate has been murdered, but another gray. Both lay dead in Flare's room. We must move you for there could be another involved in the murder.< the click and clacks of Love stop as the thoughts top.

Guile scratches side of butt. He stiffs snott.

Both stares.

Love snaps clack and sees strong. >MOVE, GUILE.<

Guile rolls to side and blops to ground. He grabs his Branhing armor and pulls it over. He only fastens the buttons.

A few guards step around in the hall. The shadows sways and a light behind fades.

Love stares at Guile.

Guile fastens the the Branching armor and rolls the robe of riegn around the daggers, gray suit and pack. He fidgets and pulls the sheet from the bunlde. Sweat gathres on vfore ehad and dampens his frew strans of hair.

The Love purrs through Guile.

And guile's heart calms and mind spreads through from an ordered set of endless outcomes to the feeling of...

Guile steps and stares with bundle clasped close to chest.

Love steps back. She clicks and clacks and sees to Guile, >You follow me.< Love turns.

Soildiers steps a path to and from door and along hall. 

,,Clean it up!'' Ritten's voice snaps.

A few grays peers from doors. Their rooms dark. 

The darkness bends back ands soliders step back from Love to lead Guile from the room. 

The shadows shift and reach away from Love. The shadows shift and slide from Love's path.

Love leads along the hall to the stairs and up two levels the along a hall with no doors. The hall interects and Love steps to the Wane.

The purple and yellow soliders lead and follower. Shadow create a tunnel. 

A few soiders of black and red step from what seems like the wall.

the wall raidiates a sim llight like twilight.

Guule sess to Love, >Where go?< He feels a purr and nothing more.

The walk the hall a stone throw from the intersection and stop. The soldiers stand at attention.

Love steps and clicks and clacks a pace. She stands.

The soldiers stare.

Guile steps and follows and looks at wall between a wide soldiers gap. 

A shadow appears oer the wall. Dim light shines around the shadow.

Love clicks and clacks and sees to Guile. >Guile, follow into the shadow door.< She steps into the shadow. 

Guile looks from side to side. 

Soliders stands with back against the wall, facing each other along the hall. The shadows waver and flux.

Guile sniffs and scratches scalp, steps into shadow.

Cold tickles the skin. The balance sways and tips.

Guile stumbles to a glass floor and large glass room.

The shadow door brightens to light.

Light feels the room.

The large glass room spanes a short ceiling square.

Two doors with tapesty hanging over, lay on the other side before.

Aling the walls to the wax and wane, are two tables. ON the wane side is a table of bottle holf full of red, blue, pink, brown and tan liquids in tall, short, round, squeare bottles. Along the wax wall is a long table of bowles and plates filled and covered with bread, fruite, meat and root. Brown root fumes is stinging smell.

On the center are two half-circle seats that circle a twenty stride circle from the center for room. Both seats are covered with blanket and pilles. Small wood arm rises rise ever few pillows. The arm rests have small places form pipe ash, food sheells and food trays. A few goblets sit in a few arm rests. An emapy plate with small bones sits on a seat near guile.

Love sees to Guile as she walks to the tapesty covered doors, >We are a private owner's room. Our minds are safe here. The walls are thick. They prevent wasy mind tapping.< She opens the doors. 

Door opens to a bright hall that interscets a few strides to a spiral staircaseup.

>Am I leavings,< sees Guile.

Love steps before the doors. >You will return.< She points

>You kill me?< Guile stops and stands in the room.

Love steps from door to Guile.

Guile sees, >When you kill me?<

Love purrs, >When you are no longer useful, you will die.<

>Flare not useful?<

>Flaree was loyal first to herself then Spear then the Mind Trust.< Love steps to the center of room where Guile stands. >|You are loyal to Guile, and you have some sexual loyalty to Minst, but Minst is no longer.<

>Dead?< sees Guile as the stare.

>Minst is a shadow soldiers,< sees Flare. She steps from the door to Guile.

Guile sees. >Why am here besided punshment?<

Flare purrs and staps, stands and looks down. >You are here to work and earn you life. AS a gray, you are given food and water. You are given reason. You have been given a path to use you mind for killing which it seem to enjoy.<

Guile smiles. >Enjoy freedom.<

>You will never be free,< sees Flare. Love steps from Giule and toward the door. >|We will always be in your mind. You actions are watched by one or many of the Mind Trust.< She steps into a dark hall.

Guile follows Love.

Love sees and leads to the spiral stair case, >Flare was given the position as training. We wanted to punish her from her attachment to Spear. Shaman Spear may have powers beyond the sight or mind, but they are not powers that help Spear survive, so her connection was deeper than the mind trut, and her loyalty need to be worked.< Love looks back as she steps on stairs. >|It didn't work.< Love looks-up as she walks up the stairs.

Guile follows, sniffs and pulls in bundle. >What didn't work?<

>we were unable to regain her focus, so she is dead. After the events during the past work cycles, we choose that she has exposed her self, and the exposure could lead to the hive mind. Her dropping a dagger was seen by many. A few mind spies were able to read of the instance from the minds of the other mind readers of th grays.<


Guile sniff... >How many read minds? ...Grays.<

>A hundred twelve of three thousand fifteen read minds. There are other who speciallize in different mental feats, but the most are used to try to plant in Warriors Waiting or near the Dome to change the outcome of the fight.< They walk stairs. >You have this ability. And it was your job for us to perform this task for both your life and to prove you can be one with the Mind Trust.< Love glances back. >|You did good work for the fight. You hide your skill. You were even able to form a trust with an untrained and nuture her ability and hide your thoughts.

>Now be watches,< sees Guile as he steps after Love.

Guile feels the purr.

Guile sees, >I want out of here. Don't want to live below ground. Don't want to live in a desert. Can help the mind trust other places..<

Love stesp a few steps and sees, >We are transporting good across the desert to the Binary Capitol to sell at the markets and give to our patrons as a gift for their support of Senator Ring at the capitol.<

>Why need to go?< says Guile.

>You can with stand a little sun. You can read minds. You are connect to the Mind Trust no matter your distance.<

>Spy,< says Guile.

>You watch,< sees Love.

Guile sniffs and rubes nose with finger. >What I do when in capitol?<

>You will work for us. There are many mind to read for profit and control.< Love steps up the stairs.

The stairs twist in a dims light.

Guile sniffs. >|Why me?<

Love steps up stairs as an id, steps and sides steps past Love. The id steps and bumps Guile.

Guile peers at the id.Love purrs. >You are loyalty to you. You want pawer. We want trust. Together you may see that in this surface world trut is all.<

>You see me across the desert?<

>No, but the trust exists beyond desert in the cities, towns and the binary capitol.<

>Two,< sees Guile with sniff.

>One capitol at the end of the great valley between the two realms.<

>Above ground?<

>The cities are to grand to be held below ground,< sees Love.

The stairs walk past an intersection with four dim light halls.

>Mind Trust rules.<

>A mind trust rules as there are many of the mind in the city of Tralidon.<

>The other,< sees Guile.

Love sees, >The other city is ruled by faith and Gods.< The purr flows to growl. An itch spreads over Guile.

Love sees, >|We have power in the near city we will be traveling once we have the warriors to travel across the desert. Once the delivery is made then you be given opprotunity for power.<

Guile scratches neck. >When?< and stumbles on step.

>We are waiting for the warriors we want to select for the journey. We have about forty cycles. The journey will begin during cooler time of the year.< 

The stairs spiral through another intersection of dim halls. A human woman stands in white robe at the end of the short hall.

>Want out soon. Bathe. Not sand. Sand boths.< Guile shakes hand through hair.

Sand falls to steps. 

Love steps to the side of the steps. 

An intersection span four halls of lights to doors.

A hugoblin wearing blue ropes  like Senator Ring steps down the steps followed by a few people wearing gray robes and one waring leathers and feathers over body.  

Love nods at the robbed figure.

The robed figure nods at Flare and glances at Guile as it walks down the stairs. Its robe sways side to side brushing the steps.

The creatures walkins behind pound steps. One human wearing a black cloak and leather with shiny studds stares at Guile.

Guile huffsa nd looks on stepping after love.

Love strides the stiars higher and higher. 

Guile see, >Who will I be leaving with?<

Love walks soft steps and silent mind.

The stairs spiral aroun and around.

A dware wearing velvet purple pants, brimmed hand and monicle steps down passing Love with a nod and Guile with a sneer.

Guile pauses and walks, wipres forehead and pulls arms around bundle.

They walk the steps up and up passing no doors or halls. The walls illuminate a dim whitelight that illuminates the contrast between Guile's pale skin and dirt packe dfinger nails. Small bit of sand sprad over guile and fall-off during steps up and up and up until they step to a hall.

Hall is wids and spans Wax and Wane. The hall ends with two double doors. Along onse side the hall are ten pairs of double doors fives strides apart.

Love strides from the steps and along the hall to the end. As she approaches the double doors, the double doors open.

The double doors open to a darkness.

Love steps inside.

Guile follows.

Guile sees, >Why do you want the guantlet?<

Love sits straight and pushes breast toward guile. >The guantlet destroys the philarcary in the middle of the small shield. The philcarcary is a node to conntect the lich to this world and the next to live beyond with power. The lich needs the philacary. The guantlet was created by Carlos the Barded Dwarf with the help of hte dwarves to kil the priestest that lost mind lusting for Carlos and wanted to extend her life for love.< Love laughts. >At least that is what Carlos the Barded Dwarf writes. Carlos did help create the guantlet, but only to steal the small shield and loot the ruins of the ancient city barried beneth the far binary city. Carlos crafted the guantlet with the dwarves to kill the then mostpowerful of all the empire the Head Cleric of Grondlin, the war God. The guantlet was made from aromor Carlos stole from a paladin or was it a the hammer and anvil at the alter to use to create the guantlet to kill the lich priest. An avatar for Grandlin. Carlos helped create the guntlet by stealing the materials. He stole books for the runes. He stole the diamind for the tip of the tomb that as in the Lich's eye when it was passified and distracted by another group of adventures Carlos sent with the hope of riches.<   
   
Guile looks at Love.   
   
>The guantlet's blood line curse comes from the diamond in the glove.<   

Guile snorts. >Carlos the barded...<

>Carlos is a thief,< sees Love. >Carlos knew of the guantlet had by the black dragon. He knows the worth to the empire. He lead William and the others to find it where he left it with the dragon eggs he stole.<

Inside,  a bright light shines to the Wane. 

The door shuts. the bright light to the wane closes to dark like curtains spread over a window.

Darkness seeps through the sight.

Guile sniffs.

Bright lights shine.

The shine illuminates a narrow and long room. A table covered in white clother and statcked with bottles, bowls and plate of liquid and food. From the door and under the tables a black rug coveres the floor and spans to the and where a curtain hangs. the curtuains is black and ruffled. It hangs before two sofa benches with cushioned back that rest on a tiered platform one below the other.

A long pole rests against the wall near the curtains and sofas.

Guile stares at the table.

The table bottles are full of liquie. The table bowls are full of berries and bread. The table plates are full of ribs stacked and steaming.

The doors closes, and a tiny gnome wearing gray robes steps along the black carpet toward Love.

Love walks to the two couches facing the curtains, sees, >You may eat your fill after you gather it on a plate and come sit next to me.<

Guile grabs a plate and puts on top two peices of bread, whipped butter, steaming potatoes, four warm ribs and a pile of beans. The thick bean juice drips of the end of plate as Guile walks to the sofa.

The gnomse in the gray robe wipes carpet spots stained with bean juices.

Guile sits on the lower couch next to Love. He scoops beans with fingers.

Love clicks and clacks and snaps.

AS guile bites then swallows all the beans. He shovers piece of garlic and cheese bread into mouth.

The gnome holds a fork before Guile with a towel drapped over forearm.

Love sees, >We are safe to think in this room.<

>Hive not protect,< sees Guile as he sucks on finger.

The gnome stands and holds the fork near Guile.

>We can be thought like any other being. It is true there are many who scan the Mind Trust for intruders, and we do find many, but one can not be too careful with thoughts,< sees love.

Guile grabs the towel form the gnomes forearm and wipes hands, smacks lips and burps, grabs fork and stabs meat chunk. >This goes to the dome and the pit.< says Guile looking at the curtain.

>It opens to reveal he dome and pit below.<

Guile snorts throguh nose. >You want me to control a fight.<

>We want you to listen. Then you may doe as you pease to the two warriors below,< sees Love.

>Tell,< sees Guile then pause glances from the rolls to Love. >You tell me all.<

,,I do what?'' says Guile he looks from the fight to Love.

Love watches the fight and sees to Guile. >You get the guantlet. You meet us in the pit. You follow us to the...<

>How?< sees Guile.

>You find us,< sees Love.

>You see to me location. I will meet you there.<

>You know the location you will be given more information. You thoughts and memories will have our goal compromised.<

>You tell me when?<

>You know to execute the plan when you see William's dead body. You need to leave with it and meet us during the walk from this building.< Love purrs through Guile. >You will feel mor through the Mind Trust once you are near.<

>Near. How near. ...<

>You leave with the guantlet. You follow.<

>Can't see. ...I can't see beyond this the building. Span through the mind trust. The trust that is purring in mind. Follow it for the laugh.<

Love nods. >You mind is ignorant.<

>You mind makes me ignorant,< sees Love. The purr of Mind Trust feel like a scratch over thoughts. >We will guide if you have the guantlet.<

>And leave.<

>You leave the city with Ghhrend.<

>William, Spear, Kirra...Myst. what of Myst? Myst...<

Guile sees, >How to join the caravan.<

Love sees, >They will lead you the Ghrend's big tent. Grend will leave the tent with the last haul of armor to be transferred over the desert. You follow.< She sips. >You follow the team transporting to the caravan stagging area. Once you find area, you blend in with the hundreds making the journey across the desert.<

>The caravan is small,< sees Guile.

Love purrs. >The jouney is not to the Rise. There will be no warriors, but what the Mind Trust pays. It is money.<

Guile sees, >And we blend in and hide.<

Love sees, >You coverd and hide. You make the journey.<

>How many suns rise to desert edge?<

>You will travel fifty suns and ten farlengths a day.<

>Five hundred farlengths?<

>Five hundred to the port at the edge of the valley.<

>Food...Do we need to bring our food and water,< says Guile.

Love purrs. >You are part of the caracan. You will have food provided and accounted. The pack, those who follow you, they will need to bring the food to drink and water to drink. They need to hide. Ghrend will know where you and others go and be. John of the Goblinkin will be leader of the caravan. He will be knowing of you journey, but has been ordered to remain away.<

>A cart. Bags.<

Love purrs. >You find the way if you want to live.<

>If we die?< says Guile.

Love sips wine. >YOu die.<

,,How do I get to William witout map?'' say Guile.

Love glanes and glances away from Guile's stare. >You don't follow your mind at the time and you will find William with a pack.<

Guile blinks, squints, ,,What?''

Loves sees, >You don't follow your mind at the time and you will find William with a pack.<

Guile thinks,  >You don't follow your mind at the time and you will find William with a pack.< 

Love sees, >You see this thought and do not forget the thought. The thought will lead you to William with a pack.<

,,What,'' says Guile. He peers and looks away from love. ''You don't follow you mind at the time to find William.''

Love exhales and blows out. She leans back and watches the fight. >See. You don't follow your mind at the time and you will find William with a pack.<

>Don't follow mind to find Willaim at the time,< sees Guile. ?I see how I will see. Why I see it?<

>YOu will know when it is time to get to find William and Myst and the priests of tone.< Love sips wine. >You see, You will know when it is time to get to find find and Myst.< Love sees. >When you find Myst you will then go to the bizzar. There will be a wagon to look covred and filled with gladiator armor. The wagon will hold size bodies from the city and into a 200 person caravan. The wagon will have you supplies for the journy. Your placement will be near the end of the wagon train lead by John of the Goblinkin. John of the Goblkin will know of your existence, but will not inspect the read of the wagon train. Other travalers walk the desert. The caravan will lead ot the edge city if Mirror.

>Mirror?<

Love says, >Mirror relects the sky from the grand until white fields of salt rise to the lands and forests of the east. Mirror has also a lake much like goblin port.<

The scratch becomes a thought cut.

Guile winches. Body flexes and pulls. He sees, >You...<

Love sees, >You return and follow your mind to find what you need. Feel...<

>Feel?< sees Guile.

Love purrs through minds. >You see what you need to see to live and help.<

The curtain slides open to reveal the a huge sphere and stadium above and below. The sphere looms up and down adn around in the center of the stadium and before the bleechers and the many rooms and windows curing up to a ceiling.

Guile leans forward and looks down at the bleechers.

Goblins, hugoblins, hobgoblins, humans, elves, dwarves, halfings, gnomes, orcs and id sit, stand and jump with shouts and whistles.

Guile peers at the spot and sees the people kick and drip root and bread bits to the bleecher steps.

Guile leans close and looks at the bleecers and see a flash of a head walk past until a stomoing foot rests and an orc sits.

Above the bleeches and above where love and guile sit is an curved wall with curtuans haning to rooms like the one Guile is in.

Guile looks at the dome with in two arm lenghs of where they sit. 

A few poles extend from the arch of suites where sihlouteets sit. The poles hit the sphere with a rhty

>See,< Guile looks over the people stand.

The people begin to clap and stomp on bleechers.

Guile steps and sits on couch and bites bread, sees, >You see to the warriors from here.<

>I see many things from here.< She raise her hand and snaps fingers.

The gnome in gray robe walks to table, pour wine.

Love looks over the people.

Guile swallows bread and drink wine and looks over dome and the people.

The roar and chants thumps chest and clouds the thought.

>When will I leave for desert?< sees Guile.

Love reaches and grabs a flute of wine from the gray robed gnome. She sips as Guile stares. Love sees to Guile, >We will leave once we have chosen a few of the warriors you will be travelling. You will leave once you have signed the contract to complete the job.<

Guile looks at Love,  says with food in mouth and sees, ,,>Contract?'' Then swallows. >|What type of contract?<

Love swallows and looks over the crowd. >You remember permission sheet you were given in the Goblin Port?<

The pole hits; feet stomps and hand claps hit in rhythm.

Guile swallows food and clears mouthing. He stares at the black ceiling above. His mind sees open. >The Goblin Port. The Goblin Port. The sheet for...For...YOu see the sheet we received to leave the city. The credit sheets. Contracts made same.<

>Yes,< sees Love. She sleeps wine. >We will discuss your contract as we watch this next fight.<

>Fight.< Guild drinks and swallows wine from flask. >|Can I fight?<

Love reaches from couch and grabs pole leaning against wall. >If you can hide your mind then fight as you may.< She reaches with pole and hits the edge of the sphere with the pole. >|If you are cought then you will pay. The Mind Trust can help you hide, put can not help you evade all thought.<

She hits the sphere in rythm with the rest of the sound.

The sound pounds.

Guile chews and stares. >Never...I never seen a fight from beyond the bleechers.

Love sees and taps the surface of the sphere.

Guile peers at the bottom of the sphere.

At the bottom of the sphere is a dark hole.

Around the room, the pound of foot, hand and pole pounds.

The pound hits with Guile's heart. His eyes open, and he sits on the edge of seat as stares at the bottom of Sphere and the darkness. Guile stomps a foot and chews.

A bald head appears from the shadow at the bottom the a chest. The a shaved muscles chest.

A near naked human wearing only leather trousers and tatoos rises into the sphere.

The stomps of stick and body parts increase and fall out of pace as cheeers through off the chorus's timing.

The human flexes musces and steps from the platform as it lowers.

The human runs around the arch of the sphere raising arm. He flips and does cartwheels around the tube.

Then from the darkness at the bottom a silver shine glares the becomea  helm. The helm becomes armored warrior holding long swords and a buckler. A guantlet grips the buckler.

The crowd claps and a few cheer. ,,WILLIAM WESTMORE!''

Guile peers and says, ,,William.''
