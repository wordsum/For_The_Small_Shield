>Can you pick the lock,< sees Guide to Shake's mind.

<Can you get us out of mountain,> thinks Shake.

Guide and shakes lift pillows and pile dried food into a pillow covers. Shake pushes the Selected Prose of Carlos The Barded Dwarf into pillow case. He pushes in two silver candle sticks and rolls of parchment.

Guide sees to Shake, >Plates are worthless,< as he grabs his pillow case and walks to the bars closet to Shake. He sees beyond the dark and with the heat of creatures walking walkways and the lines of lights etching the reliefs in the dark city. >Open the lock when ready.<

<Can't you use your mind?> says Shake.

>No.<

Shake pulls a riped sheet and ties it around the full pillow case making a tight soundless bundle then ties the sheet around waist.

Guile watches and follows Shakes example of bundling and tying the pillow cover pack while Shake fidgets and twists and picks at hair.
        
Shake pulls thin files and long wire from his matted locks of hair slipping each freed pick between lips. He tosses locks over head to neck. and pulls two wires from mouth and betweent to fingers.
        
The wires slide to lock and send touch of tumblers and lock depth. Shake pulls a long wire from mouth and puts long small rod into key hole. He thinks, <Any one near or watch.>
        
>No,< sees Guile. 
        
Shake presses on rods and feels the tumblers slide and twist.
        
The lock twists and the bolts slides.
        
The doors swings.
        
Shake catches the door and swipes and wipes the lock picks from lock and mouth to palm of hand. <Anyone watching?>

>No,< sees Guile.

Shake opens the door steps  by stool and to the walkway and into darkness. He follows path of line of red that turn purple as he walks to Guile's door. He thinks, <That's bad.>

>A few in cells watch.<

<They stare,> says Shake as she takes the picks puts them between lips and into lock.

>Yes.<

The lock slides and the door opens.

<Then we go.>

Guile pushes door, and door squeak. Guiles sees a few people laying on pillows look to he and Shake.

<You lead,> says Shake. As Guile passes, Shake places a string in hand. <|Grab so I can follow in dark.>

Guile fumbles the strings, stops with a near stomp and sees, >Where is it.<

Shake sees the sihlouette of Guile and finds hand and pust rope.

Guile sees the through darkness like a black and white night with grays near black spreading a quick sprint distance. He walks along the path pulling the string. 

Shake follows the tug and the red lines along paths near dim and dark jail cells hanging from the darkness.

Empyt and full cages hange side to side like rows along the path.  Dwarves, a human, an elves and three being roaming cells as large rats fill the many cages left to right to the turn the path to a mural etched on a distand wall. 

The mural ectches the a scene with green and brown of trees and grass showing sprites and faires flying over flowers to the peak of a hill. As Guile and Shake step, the images of the mural move across the rock with the pace of the walk.

Shake and Guile stare as the walk to see the faires and sprites fly with eacy step. The images come to life from the mural.

,,Free me,'' says a voice from the Sprites and fairies flying. ''Free me!'' one says a little louders.

Guile and Shake slow step and see  the shapes fly and hove. They stare and watch the mural.

A loud crash of plates again followed by a shout, ''FREE ME!''

The mural becomes still lights. Shake and Guile look away from the mural to a cage. Their minds see the fairies and sprits flying around a dwarv with dirty white beard. His fingers piont at Guile and Shake as the stand and stare away the images of sprites and farise.

Guild stares at the dwarf. He loses sight. His hand loose grip on the sting. His pupiles widen then shut.

Shouts and whispers of the shouting voice echoes around Guile. Guild puts hands over hears.

The dwarf before Shake and Guild opens mouth, but nothing comes out of the old dwarfs mouth as he closes.

Vibrations and feet stomp from the darkness.

Shake blinks away the fairies and sprites outlines flying around like an illusionist show.

>Shake,< sees Guile grabing Shakes shoulder.

Shake stares into the darkness then through the darkness hand feels the vibration of foots steps and the rubbing
of armor.

,,Shake,'' says Guile.

Shake steps. <Run.>

They run. Guile leads between the dim gray and the red light illuminating at the side. The cages burr and a few prisoners stand, shout and point and Guild and Shake.

Guile and Shake run beteen the red light. The run left then right then the light fades.

Feet hit the steel walkway and the snap and clink of steel chains. 

Shake reaches and grabs onto Guiles pillow case backpack. He hear dwarven commands shout and talk between heavy breaths.

Guile hears nothing, but sees the path to the mural and the wall.

,,Do know where we are?'' says Shake.

A group of fairies fly from the wall and dive and twist and twirl around Shake.

<Fairies,> thinks Shake. <|Where?>

Guile reaches back and grabs Shakes dirt covered leather tunic and pulls. >This Way!<

Sihlouette become shadows running from the black to the gray of Guile sight. Shake sees darkness cover the relief of color lines and the fairies and sprites.

Two Warriors of The Rose run with hammars jog along path intersecting with the path Guild and Shake run.

Shake thinks loud, <Why are they?>

>RUN!<

The run over the platfor, troward the relief, to the intersection. 

Shake grabs and holds Guiles forearm stares at the ground adn not the fairies and sprites dancing around head. 

>|Left,< sees Guile. 

The step and run left along a platform running into darkness.

The huffing and gruffing and dwaven commands, ,,GIL,'' and ''RUSIN,'' are shouted from behind.

<Where?> thinks Shake. <|I thought.>

>Run,< sees Guile.

The red relief lines along the path fade to darkness.

Guile grips Shake's tunic.

Shake looks back and only sees the fading relief lines long the wall, the walk ways and the jails casting darkness.

Shouts and hollers follow behind. 

They run a straight path for countless steps. They run straining Shake's weak legs and lungs.

Shake coughs and cages and presses eyes shut to force away the pain. 

Guile feels the cough and the pain and pulls Shake along seeing to his mind. >Run. Run. Run.<

Shakes lungs begin to burn, legs strain and cramp. He hops and skips hitting hard against the steel walkway.

Guild pulls him along by the tunic only seeing the shades for gray around the darkness spanning as relief lights dim. 

Paths and platforms span from the walkway into the darkness. 

Relief lines and lights twinkle and light around the city. 

Shake coughs, gags, says, ,,What's...What's be...behind?''

>Think,< sees Guile. >|Cat not see.<

<|Are we on the path?>

>Yes,< sees Guile. 

A group of five dwarves wearing white robes and carrying staffs walk step from path and watch Guile and Shake run past. 

Shouts and grunts are heard in the dark. 

<What they sayin'> thinks Shake.

>Stop the prisoners. Stop the prisoners,< translates Guile to thought for shake to see in mind. Guile looks back.

He see hues of shapes of warriors at the edge of vision. 

Shake hears their armor clinging and clacking between his breaths into buring chest.

<How far,> think Shake.

>Run,< sees Guile >|Run.<

They run. They run away the hues of being running behind. The run beyond the darkness of the reliefs. The run past murals of birds and flying through clouds. They run along the walk way illuminated blue. They run past people standing on platforms watching them run. They run...

Shake's lungs feel the run's burn. He hold lungs from burst into coughs as  Guile guides feeling and hearing and seeing the black and white with shades of gray span before. 

Guile pushes a thought shout from mind. The shout echoes through Shake's minds then fades then echoes. 

The echoes enter Guile's mind like a hundred people talking in a pub at once. Voices shout, whisper and command. 

Guile hears all and the commands and voice of Hern.

>Hern,< sees Guile to Shake.

<HERN.> Thinks Shake, <|How far.>

>We near.<

The runs as fast as Shake's weak body moves them through the darkness and dim lights of the illuminated reliefs etched over wall. The run and run and run until Guile slows and stops and pushes back against Shake. He pulls right and steps right. 

>The door.<

<Where?>

Guile pushes Shakes against the door.

Shake feels cold steel. 

>Hurry.<

<Can't see.>

>Are you any good?< sees Guild to Shake's mind.

Shake slips a needle from locks and says between breaths. ,,It's difficult do good when everyone around treats you bad.'' Shake feels the tumbler and pulls four more needles from locks. He twists and nudges. Sweat drips from Shake head to hands causing needles to slip.

>They near.< 

Shake slips, fumbles then wipes hand. He slows his breathing and laughs. He closes eyes and grabs the needles with fingers.

,,SHAKE! GUILE!'' is shouted by Hern.

Shake feels the needles push the tumblers, twists the lock as Shake turns a wheel handle and push the door.

The door doesn't open.
