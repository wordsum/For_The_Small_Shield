<Guile,> thinks Shake to self.

>Yes, Guile.<  thinks Guile to Shake.

,,Why you do that?'' says Shake.

>|Talk in your mind.<

,,Yes,'' says Shake puttting hands over ears.

Guiles mouth moves saying, ,,Because I am.''

Shake lowers hands. He nods and looks around the cage.

The four walls of bars glow in even light the fade to darkness and circles and lines of light. The steel jail cell hangs before a walkway. It's clean floor, ceiling and bars shine white light reflection.

A plate and cup rest near wall where a stool and walkway rest beyond the bars. The plate is covered with potatoes, grass, corn, meat and bread rolls.

Shake feels hunger pains stare from the food. He walks then kneels and shuffles to plate. Hands and fingers dig, scub, push, pull food potatoes, gress, pork into mouth. Hand grab cup and water pours and filters through food. Shake chews and swallows.

Shake eats and eats then says between chews, ,,When is it?'' He looks at Guile. ''How long?''

,,Rotations. Been here ten. Maybe twenty before that,'' says Guile.

Shake shrugs and jerks head back and nods, swallows, wipes mouth with forearm, says, ,,Cycle  to rotatiosn that's...'' He shakes head, puts food in mouth and says a muffled, ''Don't matter.''

,,How long you remian in cage?'' says Gile.

Shake chews and glances to Guile with a smile. ,,Til I'm ready to go.''

,,How long the punishment?'' says Guile.

Shake chews, swallows, says, ,,Fifty-seven resolutions.''

,,Where you go?'' smiles Guile. He steps backward over pillow.

,,Away.'' 

Guile chuckels and lays on back over pillows. His stomach pokes from stomach and wide tone arms foldo over chest. 

Shake eats.

,,Is it true you stole a Heart Knife?''

,,I took a knife,'' says Shake. He shurgs and stares with Guile. ''My pack need to money when we left here.''

Guile lift head from pillow and stars along the hill like plane of his chest and stomach. He grins. ,,You crazy.''      

Shake peers at Guile. ,,I'm not crazy.''

,,You crazy. They staps hearts for stealing heart daggers,'' says Guile. He nods at the empty stool. ''Ask Hern, Grun.''

Shake's shoulder slump and neck bends. ,,I didn't know.''

,,And you are alive.'' Guile

,,Why you here?'' says Shake.

,,My father asked for my help healing your mind.''

,,Why you here?''

Guile sits up and leans back on arms. He looks at Shake. ,,I made a man mad with his own hate he feels for my mother.''

,,Why he hate your mom?'' says Shake lowering food.

,,She's human,'' says Guile.

Shake chews and looks at Guile. ,,Mad is what the man should be.''

Guile lays head back on pillow. ,,It's difficult to be good when everyone around you treats you bad.''

Shake stares. ,,Can I use that in song?''

,,Use it as you like.''

,,Yea,'' says Shake. ''I,'' Shake sits against bars and side looke through bars to guile. ''I suppose you know reading my mind, but I use to hate dwarves.''

,,I do hate,,'' says Guile. 

Shake mouth full of food chews. ,,Leave.'' Shake burps. ''Why got be here?''

,,Where?'' says Guile.

,,With me?'' says Shake. ''Leave here before last day.'' He looks around the jail cell. ''Where's my pack?''

Guile says, ,,Hern has it.''

Guile says, ,,Hern has it.''

,,Why he got it?'' says Shake.

,,You're jailed,'' says Hern's voice.

Shake looks through bars along the path. ,,In my mind.''

>|No,< sees Guile to Shake's mind. >|My mother controls the thoughts.<

,,Are you good,'' says Hern. His voice flows from the darkness nearly like it is spoke to the mind.

Shake chews and swallows. ,,It's difficult to be good when everyone around you treats you bad.''

Hern steps from darkness to the faint light fade to dark from the stool. ,,How's his mind, Guile?''

,,Sane, as is said with the surface talk,'' says Guile.

Hern sits on the stool and lets out a groan and sniffs. ,,I see Guile has opened your mind and body.''

Shake chews. ,,Where's my pack?'' He glance at Hern then food and stares at Hern.

,,It hangs on a beg in a closet,'' says Hern. His cheeks puff with grin. ''it will be return when you leave the cell.''

,,And the pillows. The chair. The rugs,'' says Shake. He grins and peers at Hern. ,,Or does he get special treatment.''

Hern chuckles. ,,After a rotation of no Speed Spasms you will be given what you want.''

,,Where's William? Spear.'' Shake walks from the plate with blades of thick grass and potatoes speared on cheek. He wipes cheek with forearm. 

Hern pushes back glasses. ,,Service their self imposed punishment.''

,,What about my self impossed punishment?'' says Guile.

Hern while looking ate Shake says, ,,An imprisonment with walls and not illusion of madness as you have given.''

Guile chuckles. ,,Honor and inults. No mouth is shut.''

Shake burps, hits chest then yawns. ,,How much longer til I'm free?''

,,Seventeen rotations,'' says Hern.
