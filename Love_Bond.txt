Guile is waist deep in swamp water.

,,Guile, you wake,'' says Love.

Guile stops and twists. Feet sink on mud.

White wisps of myst flow around hips. The lilly pads float.

''Wake and be with me,'' says Love. Guile feels body vibrate a tickle that sooths a pain in ankle.

Guile long legs slide slide from mire. His long arms hit moss. His narrow head lifts above the trees.

Stars shine above.

,,Guile, you wake to be with me,'' say Love before.

Guile stands as still as a tree.

>|Guile, you be alive, but in your own mind. Or you will be dead,< sees Senator Ring into Guile's slow mind.

Guile feels the ripple in pontd tab code around the trees from the trolls that stands and stare at the stars.

>|Guile, you will die if you do not see from the memory,< see Senator Ring.

Guile breathes a moan.

Trolls around breath a bass through the trees and waters. They step their long legs and silently and slowly walk through the swamp.

>Lost,< sees Love. >|In a swamp seeing these thoughts.<

>Guile,< sees Senator Ring. His voice cools like the water. >|You are following the moan. You are either waiting to over hear Love and I pass thoughts to help give you advantage or your weak body wants to follow the moan.<

Guile hears cackle laughter. Clicks and clacks rap in rhythm. He opens eyes.

Stares twinkle above. They light the dark sky above.

Around lights shine through the night from towers that rise from a dark plane below.

The wallls and ceiling are transluted. 

Guile sits from lay. He feel the glass, the fur rug. A woven straw rug spread from the glass walls. Pictures hang along the glass walls. The glass walls see through room with bed; a room with chairs, a room with shelves and food. From one side Guile sees lights shine from glass buildings that rise from a dark plane below. A few glass building rise hight and shine bright lights of red and blue.

Red and blue radiate through the dark to touch the sky and coverstars. 

Guile stairs. He gags and coughs and coughs. Snott spray from mouth and nose over a white fur rug.

The white fur rug spans to a long wooden chair with pillows. A wooden shelve of books. A circle table.

Senator Ring and Love stands at far edge of white fur rug.

>You live?< sees Love to Guile. She dressed in a loose yellow cape with a bowl like white collar that circles head and partly covers chin. The cap is pulled tight and hangs bellow needs to the top of white boots.

>You have not wasted my time,< see Senator Ring to Guile. He dressed in a green robe over bight body. White gloves and boots stick from bottom and sleeves. A white cap tops Senatro Rings big rectangle head. His large mouth smiles wide. ,,The Priests of Hillion can sing miracles.''

Senator Rings voice sooths the throb in Guile's head.

Cinnomon and fresh bread fumes flow over Guile.

Guile sneezes and wipes mouth and nose with forearm. He looks at Love.

His burning eyes dry and water. 

Love steps toward Guile and stands above. She looks down over her chest. Her boots reflect shines of light. A Heart Dagger is clutched in her hands.

The Hear dagger is nearly as long as a short sword. Its hilt is a relief of dwarves holding hands and standing on shoulders to rise around a red gem.

Love drops the Heart Dagger next to Guile's 

Guile's heart beats slow and calm. He grabs the dagger.

Warm spreads from handle, Guile's hand and through Guile's body. Warm spreads to head and toe then cools leaving the pain in ankle a tinkling pulse.

Love steps from Guile and smiles. >|You have shown us the Troll Death Moan. You are free to leave.<

,,Where,'' says Guile. 

Love walks to the table and grabs a pack.

Senator Rings points index finger to mind. He sees, >The city.<

,,The,'' says Guile. He stops, sniff. >Leave the city?<

Guile grabs Heart Dagger and stands feeling ankle tingle. >Leave. Can't leave. William, Spear, Kirra, Myst and Minst.< He stands and look at Senator Ring and Love. He steps to the table. 

The table is clear expect a platter. The platter is covered with sausage, bread and cheese with a jug and three cups.

Guile grabs some sausage and cuts it with his knife. >Where can I go? What do I have? Am I free free?< He puts a cut piece of sausage in mouth and looks at Senator Ring. 

Sentor Ring laughs deep. >Your friends are now earning to pay off their debt or their lives.<

Love walks to a wall facing the city of glass along the planes.

Guile looks at his white sheets stainde with sweat, piss and shit. Rings of sands and blood stain pits. Dirt crusts finger nails. ,,A bath.'' He looks at Senator Ring and Love. >A bath. And a map. And a talking with my pack. Where's Minst? Can I talk with Minst?<

Senator Ring exhales mint and humms. >Minst has been selected work off his debt beyond the gladiator pit. And Myst has been taken to a safe place to live and sing with the those short little gnomish priest that make the walls humm.< Senator Ring points a Guile. >|You hear and feel it during the dark time.< Senator Ring closes robe. >|Kirra, Spear and William have agreed to work off their debt fighting in the pits. It is in the pits whwere they can fight for life.< Senator Ring raises a hand and puts hand on Guile's shoulder. >You have paid your debt my mindly friend, so if you wish a bath or supplies before you part then Love will lead youto your needs. You can be on your path from this city and the desert<

>Leave?< sees Guile. >Leeave where? I...<

Senator Ring stares at Guile. >You will be given you robe and items and food for your recovery as those little majic casters didn't waste to much faith in giving you life, so your step will be a bit slow and thoughts a bit more dense for a few rises of light.<

>When can I talk with my friends?< see Guile.

>Your friends,< sees Love as she looks through the night and over the dark plane. >|Your friends have forgot you.<

Senator Ring step from Guile and pours wine from the jugs to the cubs. >Your friends little care or concern for your health. They do worry about Minst and Myst, but even those feeling of the fight ones dime like the light.<

Senator Ring sees, >LovteKitLkoi, we have what we need from Guile. We will let him find his way in this new world.<

Guile swallows. He looks at Love then Senator Ring. >Where can I go? Can I wait here? Can I wait for Minst? Can I return to Lyno?< He clears thraots, swallows.

Senator Ring look at Guile then around the room and steps to pace while seeing to Gile and Love,  >You can leave this building as free being, but you cannot remain. You can find work through the city and rent a small space below the ground.< Senator Ring winks at Guile. >|You will need more than money to find a place to live above the sands. You need money to pay to return to Lyno.<

Guile eats bread and sees, >Work? Will the goblins kill me?< sees Guile.

Senator Ring's laughs. The laught spreads through minds. >You are of know concern to the endless goblinkin living to the Rise of the desert. You will discover the many goblinkin nations and I am put a Senator of one, the largest, but not the most powerful. You are right in concerning how goblinkin beyond the desert and the great canyon will find you dwarf and human traits to be less than...< Senator Ring nods. >Less than welcome.< He raise arms as he paces. >But here.< He stops by Love and the wall window looking over the city. >|Here you will be another citizen now. A citizen free to earn and grow old.<

Guile swallows. He steps and feel pain in ankle. He grabs the Heart Dagger and limps toward Senator Ring and Love dragging foot through the fur rug. >What can I do?<

Senator Ring looks back at Guile. >You leave.<

>Leave. I show you the Troll Death Moan,< sees Guile. He mouth breathes and sniffs, limbs to stand close to Senator Ring as he stares at Senator Ring.

Senator Ring look over the dark plane of the desert at night. >Guile, you showed us valuaable skill that will provide us with a tool to help our work for power. You have been paid for that skill with you life and the cost of the damage done to the road (INTHESWAMPLAND), the damage to the hotel and the cost for bringing you here, to this city.< Senator Ring looks down at Guile. >We owe you nothing. YOu owe us nothing.<

Giule huffs. ,,Grolin.'' He steps. ''Where robe and cloths?'' He steps to the cotton bed. He grabs the branching armor, robe of Rieghn and pack. He walks to the table and puts bread in back.. He mumbles. ''Hulrim johniun grolin,'' says to surface talk. ''Kill me take me. Release me. Gods.'' He says loud after grabbing the back and walking to the Robe of Reighn. ''GOD LET GO.'' 

Senator Ring sees, >You will want to stop by the kitchen and grab a few waterskins. Water is expensive in the desert.< Senator Ring puts his hand into robe pock and steps from wind and at Guile.

Guile drops the robe of Reighn, the bag and steps into the Branching Armor.

>Your branching armor will keep you cool in the desert. It may help you find a cheep place to sleep.< Senator Ring pulls hand fro robe pocket and open palm. 

A square glass cube rest on palm. 

>|The cube gives credit enough to get passage on caravan across the desert. It will pay for about thirty rises of city tax.< 

Guile stares at the cube. He pulls arm through branching suit sleeve and grabs the cube. He puts other arm through sleeve and holds up the cube. ,,Glass.''

>|Credit Cube holds your worth with light and magic.< Senator Ring tosses the cube.

Guile reaches for catch. Cube his fist and bounces down, falls to ground. Guile bends with a back pain and grabs the cube, the robe of reighn and pack. >Cube pay enough until William and Spear are released.< He lifts the cube and peers at it.

The cube is th size of the tip of thum. Small grooves rest on side. A flow of magic treads around the thins seam of the cube. 

Senator Ring stesp back and walks to walls. >They may live or they may not.< 

>Will pay for a caravan from the desert?< see Guile. He drops the pack and pult on the Rope of Reighn.

>You have only enough money to help you find your way,< sees Senator Ring. He turns adn walks to the window wall and stands next to Love.

Guile shakes loose Rope of Reighn and rolls sleeve. Dried blood cracks along sleeve. He pack tied slips from hand.

The bag falls and bread roll rolls over the fur near a blood stain.

>You could find Branching?< sees Senator Ring. Senator Ring looks back at Guile. >|We do have a transportation of armor across the desert to Tralindan.< He looks throgh the window at the twinkling lights. >|The caravan leaves in thirty rises.<

Guile picks up pack. He stairs. He breathes. 

His body shrugs.

Snot drips from Guile's nose.

Senator Ring's voice hums.

Sunflowers and sun fumes flow over Guile and the room.

Guile's head flows lights. His stomach feels to drop, sink. ,,Need a pot.''

He drops his bag and walks arond th glass room. >Pot or a hole for...< He farts.

Sentor Ring sees, >YOu may leave your waste on the fur rug.< He steps from the window wall. >|The rug will be removed before the Rise reaches Zenith.

Guile stands. Stomach bubbles. Poop pushes. Guile farts. He pulls of Robe of Rieghn. ,,Room.''

>|You have room here...< see Seantor Ring. >|It will cost you once you leave.<

Guile farts and steps. >|Where do you...< He steps and runs dow a hall with tapestry hanging on the sides. Steel doors rise from either side, and the hall ends with wooden door.

,,GLOLIB,'' shouts Guile. He sees loud, >WHERE?<

Love sees, >You go through the wooden door and use the large bowl.<

Guile presses on the door.

The door does move.

Guile twists the handle.

Door opens. Two bowls rest in the corners of the rooms. One big one small. Wood relief panels cover walls.

Guile pulls the branching armor from body. He lifts the white sheets. He shits.

Wiffs of shit fume around guile. 

Around wood panel reliefs cut a picture of stars and clouds. Along the gloass floor is a hole sinks into the floor and a small podium with clear liquid. Towels hang from a hook near the small podium.

Love sees to Guile, >Water is in the podium. You use the towels to clean and drys.<

Guile shits. Guile cleans hands and drys hands. He dresses. He walks hall, grabs the Robe of Rieghn. ,,What cost to leave waste? How...''

Senator Rings says, >Guile, talk with your mind, so we may all see and feel togther your questions.< Senator Ring stands by the table.

Love stands by the large window wall.

Guile walks past Senator Ring and grabs his pack. >Where go? What do? When friends released from their...Their...< He sniffs. >|You.< He walks to love and stands at her side with gaze looking along her postured stanc. >|You learn toll mona. You help me. I help you.<

Love stares through the wall.

Guile sniffs. He looks at Senator Ring. >I help you.< He stps over the fur and the stains toward Senator Ring.

>We help you,< sees Senator Ring. >You have live. You have money. You have freedome.< He peers at Guile. >|Now you leave. Your friends will be fighting in the Sand Pits Below and if they live the Crystal Pits.

>I help you,< sees Guile. He steps to Senator Ring.

Senator ring bites bread and chews. >YOu have nothing I need to help.< He swallows. 

Guile stands. >LovteKitLkoi?<

Senator Ring laughs. The deep laugh sooths mind and makes Guile feel light headed. The laugh fills the room. >You work with Love.<

>You work for us,< sees Love. Love steps from Window.

,,Yes,'' says Guile. >Yes,< sees Guile.

Love steps close to Guile. >You open your mind for us. You do as I say.<

Guile stands. He pulls together robe. >How long?<

>How long you open you mind for use,< Love sees.

>How long you been feeding me this. This...< Guile feels burn flow through bowls.

Senator Rings says, >You know weak body creates a weak mind to see through the thoughts without your wasteland images. We walk through as you feel the burn through your bowls. We will walk the plans and uses the pain for us to peak all the thoughts and find the feelings and sights to give to you for your thoughts.<

Guile focuses on the burn of shit flowing to bowl, staning the side, fuming the stench of rot.

Fume fill guiles breath.

Senator Ring says, ,,Your stench is enough for one to be shocked, but three mind in yours give a net to read you mind.''

Love sees to Guile's mind. >YOu show us all and you will see all.<

>All?< sees Guile. The burn cools and the fumes spreads. >All of all.<

,,No,'' says Senator Ring. His voice near the wooden door. His foot steps step the hall. ''No.'' He steps.

Guile sniffs and sees to all, >Love see mine. I see Love's. Love sees your mind.<

>And I see your mind,< sees Senator Ring. Senator Ring says, ''Love

>We,< sees Guile. >|All see surface talk.<

>Surface talk is not known by most the word. The goblin click and clack have consumed the realms.<

>The surface realms sees Guile to All.<

Love steps to the hall.

Guile stands and inhales.

The fumes flow stink the nose like deep sweat fumes.

>The bot to the wax will clean,< sees Love to Guile.

Guile steps and sits on the bot. The butt and leg back slide in to warm water. >Surface talk not talked by the realms.<

Senator Ring says louds. His foots steps hear to step with the pace of his voice, ,,Surface talk is spoke by many through the cities of the Rise Empire. The fall empire, the empire that controls this city and the capital of Tallanis, Surface talk is spoke by few. The Surface Talk helps our network communicate without the prayers and spell casters trying to hear our mind.''

Love sees words to Guile's mind while Senator Ring speaks, >|You will sees the surface talk for few see the surface talk. YOu will see the surface talk, so we may seek and seep through your mind.< She ends her talk while Senator Ring ends his talk.

Guile's butt dips in water and hand rubs poop from butt. >You see in my mind. And I see you mind.<

Love sees, >You will see my mind as I live. You will see what you find as I will be open with you.<

Guile stands and wipes hand on white sheet. He looks at the dirty under nails. >What will get? Why stay to read thought.< he stiffs and look around the room. >|Got to go to...< Guile steps to a raised bowl and look at a mirror haing above it.

Guile sees through the mirror...

Guile's long thin hair sticks to scalp and pokes around hears. Lines of dirt crease his shines. He nose and lips are caked with dust and muck. Smears and stains spread over round cheeks and broad forehead. His bulgying eyes stick from sunken sockets. 

>You leave when you want to leave,< see Love. >|Open your mind to me, and you will have your bath, cloths, food and money.<

Guile steps back. He pulls the Robe of Reighn over shoulders and look at the stiff brown spots, smells the wiffs of sweat-poop.  >When Myst released?<

Senator Ring smile. >Myst is free to leave when she wishes to leave, but now she is in a Song of Reighn she appears to want to sing.<

>When see her?< sees Guile. He open his mouth.

His teeth are brown.

>Myst will leave when Myst is ready to leave,< see Senator Ring.

>Minst?< sees Guile. He wipes his cheek with wet hand until seeing a tan olive skin.

>You think in complete thoughts as we read your mind,< sees Love. >|You food, care, bathes, water and life cost credit. You thoughts are payment.<

Guile presses against thin skin flacking from tan cheek showing a pink. >Can I see Minst?<

>Minst is beyond our control< sees Senator Ring.

>Why?< sees Guile.

>Your mind open, and we will see all,< sees Love. Love steps near Guile. >|Your mind closed, and you will see no information. You will alone in the desert.<

Fumes of tulips and dew spreads over Guile.

Love sees, >|You will open mind to become with my mind and the mind I see.< Love purrs.

Purr flows through Guile. >What will I do for you?<

>You do what you are commanded to do,< sees Love.

Guile sniffs. He puts hand in to the water and scrubs.

>The sands will not sting your cuts. The water and food will be at you reach.< Senator Ring Sees. >You only need to become one with us, and we will protect you and give you purpose and life.<

Guile drinks water. 

Love sees, >You will have until the sun set upon the plane then you will be one with us or one without.<

Senator Ring sees, >You will become one outside of the coming change to the known world. Or you will be inside not only our minds, but the minds of those who will control the land.<

Guile opens the door and stesp through hall. Love stands at the end of hall near the table with food. Her back faces guile as guile walks toward her. He grips his dagger at walks to Love.

Beyond Love, by the white rug and a bundle of cloths, two gray clothes workers, an elf and gnome, kneel and roll the white fur carpet. A dwarf and human in gray robes grab the tray of bread and meat.

A purple and yellow studded leater dress soldier stands with short sword and shield between Love and the gray clothed workers.

Guile walks the hall and to Love.

Love sees, >YOu be with us or leave.<

A soldiers wearing purple and leather studded leather stops toward Love and Guile holding Guile's bundle of fuming rot and sweat.

Guile sneezes then covers nose. >What do I get?<

Love purrs.

The purr flows through Guile. 

Loves sees, >Food, water, shelter and power.< 

Love's purr flows through Guile making mind light and float.

Guile's sight blurrs and flows then focuses on the gray suited workers.

The gray suited workers lift the rolled rug and walk from the glass room. They ar followed by the gray suite workers holding the plat of food. They are followed by one yellow and purple guard while one remains with Guile's cloths.

Guile looks at his bundle and grabs his heart dagger. ,,Want all stuff had. Own room.''

Senator Ring's mental laugh quiets the purr of Love and pains Guile's head. >You are in no position to bargin. You have two options. Choose one.<

Love steps from Guile's side and from the room.

Guile stands. He looks at the bundle. He looks at Love as Love walks through the from the big room. ,,Yes,'' says Guile.

Senator Ring says, >See it to all in a complete thought until you have entered the hive.<

>yes,< sees Guile. >|I will give my mind to you in return for water, food and freedom.<

Love sways hips through doors. >You lower to your knees.<

Guile looks at Love, bends knees, slowly lowers while lookingupat Love. He stares at Love's waist.

Love sees, >Eyes close. And mind sees the dark of the mind,<

Guile closes eyes and thinks of the images of the desert planes where his jial had been.

The plan stretches and spans. He sees the flat ground pass below. 

Love presses palms over Guile's forehead.

Guile feel to vibrate. 

The image in Guile's mind shakes andquakes. One part rises while the other shifts. Guile's dream idol stands on raise edge. The edge ridses. A pool of lava surrounds guile. His plan of grann andhills becomes a moutnain regeion surrounded by lava.

The image in Giule's mind shakes and falls. Guile falls into the lava.

Guile feels a burn through mind and body. Guile sees black. Guile feel nothing.
