# For The Small Shield

It begins in a bar as Carlos the Barded Dwarf convinces a band of youth to seek their destinies beyond a small village into the canyon to reclaim the land from the goblin horde gathering.

And from the valley into the mountain and over the plains into the desert they find the horde is a civilization of goblinkin as advanced and civilized as the humans.

As the goblin world clashes with the human world, the team of adventures hold the key to stop the goblin takeover of their human lead world.


### History

For The Small Shield is a story written by Kalab J. Oster&trade; that needs editing either by humans or A.I..

It took over five years to write. A few chapters have been edited enough to not be bad, but most have not.

Given the lack of editing, it is fair to write that words...

 1 - 400,000 are very bad

 400,0001 to 800,000 are bad

 800,0001 to 1,130,000 are almost not bad.

Kalab J. Oster&trade; realizes he has too many other stories written to edit and too many other thoughts to write to ever be able to edit the words of this story even though he wants it to be a book.
