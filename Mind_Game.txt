Love sees, >Spear is infecting warriors while sparing between gladiator fights.<

Guile sees, >Is Spear were form?<

Love sees, >Spear is more rat than human. Spear change away from humans daily. Warriors see Spear as a beast. Spear spars with warriors for gladiator fights. Spear infects many warriors of the compentition. Few warriors have symptoms of disease. Some have died. Four have lived.< Love steps toward the doors, and the doors open as she continues to see with Guile. >The four have lived have infected twenty more. Three are sick. The owners of the dead and the infected have suffered, and we have profitted. We want to control those effected. Their minds becoming hard to see.<

Guile follows Love's step.  

Love leads through hall upstairs seeing. And Guile follows while Love sees. >|You will earn your freedom and access to the hive mind once you have completed you path with the warriors. We are seeing your mind, but you will not see the hive until you learn that the mind is beyond the body. You will work with me and my Shadow Soldiers to set the fighting matches, monitor Spear and learn to control a were beast like a puppet. Can you control rats with mind?<

Guile follows love up stairs, sees, >Yes, I control rats. Weremind I never control.< Guile sniffs. >|I can control.<

>You will control rats and warriors if you want to live. Two of hive killed are children of powerful parents. One is another Senator's daughter. One is a son of tradesmen. They are dead. You killed them. Senator Ring is seeing with the families now.<

Guile sneezes.

Love sees, >|You will live near the warriors. You will not see a site or see the sight of your pack. We are your pack. You will see the warriors when you help with fight. You're mind is in hive mind. You are not in hive. I will see. You my pack.<

Love steps a few steps and walks hall to single door. Cinnomon fumes blume.

Guile mouth breaths and sniffs.

Love sees, >Your path you follow.< She opens the door.

Door opens to a wide hall.

Wood slats spread from edge to edge. Black and brown paint cover glass walls. Light shines between the boards of wood and the scratches of the wall.

Four people wearing coutiru vest and pants walk together side by side leaving a trail of smoke.

Guile sneezes. 

Love steps into hall walking opposite way of the group. 

The board squeak.

Guile follows.Love sees, >You come. You obey.<

Guile sees, >Yes, I come.<

Love leands though the hall. >You will work with me. I feel your power. Your power needs control. You need guidance. Your troll moan is a toll we have learned from you. You will learn from us. You will help regain the favor with the families in Tranllinion.<

>How big hive?< sees Guile.

Love sees, >The hive mind spans to the rise and set from Trandiallion and soon Lyno. The hive has mind in Branching, Drillon and the guilds. The hive is no where.<

>Is Senator Ring the leader?< sees Guile. He double steps to keep up with Love.

>We are the leader.< sees Love.

Love leads through the hall and to steps.

The steps lead up. 

A few people walk down the steps. One laughs while two talk suface talk mumbles distant from Guile's mind.

Guile scurries two steps for Love's one. He wipes forhead and breathes. >Where are we walk?<

>We walk to your new home,< sees Love.

Light shines on Loves face as light spread from opening above. 

People walk past the light opening. Glimmering glass towers rise to the bright.

Guile squints and shields eeyes with hand. >Home? Where is my home?<

>You will be with the gladiators in the Dome and the Pit building.< Love stesp from the stairs into the crowd.

People off all shapes, size and tupes walk, run and scurrie over glass covered with sands and stains. People jostel from stairs in into doors. They push past the carts steaming and spread sents of cooked flesh and burnt fat. 

A group of yellow and purple soldiers step from a gray box near the edge of the stair case exit. The quick march to Love.

Guile sees a few of the shadows of the warrios extend and appear to walk. Guile stumbles and bumps into a stubbly little hafling. 

The haflin sneers and says, ,,And back to you!'' And steps away glancing at the soldiers.

Guile steps after Love as Love walks through the crowd.

the soldiers spread behind Love. Shadow Soldiers stretch form shadow to shaodw from the light from above. 

Guile squints and holds hand before the light. >What is the Dome and the Pit?<

>The dome and the pit is the largest area in this city. It contains the largets sphere fight ring along with many smaller riings. The dome and the pit is a feat to fight to in. It is a feat to maintain.<

>Gnomes like to fight?< see Guile as He steps from the path of a fast walking dwarf.

>Gnomes didn't bring gladiator fights to this city. We don't know who did. Gladiator pits are found in all big cities. The warriors teleporting and transporting to and from the city has made the fight profitable.

>Money,< sees Guile, wipes forehead. >|I need money.< 

>You will be given a credit cube. You will be given a mall amount of credit. You will be given room and food.< Love strides, and people step from her path. A few stubmb;e away.

Guile quicks steps to walk as fast as Love. >What I do? How I help?<

Love steps and walks from a long span toward a large open square, and Guile follows.

The square is a fast span as big as an open plane between rising glass towers. People jostle between rows of carts, booths and blankes covered with tools, trinkets and food. Smeel of baked potatos blow past. From the click and clack and murumur of crowd, a drum roll can be heard.

In the center of the field size square is a massive square buiding that rises as tall as the tallest hill. Thought is is not as tall as the glass towers round the square, it castes a shadow over the crowd.

The guards steps before Love and push people from her path.
Guile walks near.

A minotuar with gold rope hanging from horns stombs past. A small gnome shouts and walks with it. A pack of elves is parted by the soldiers.

Pushing and pulling and wedging through the crowd toward the building.     
  
People step from the paths. Smells of grabe and roses puff as they past pots smoking and boililng.

On the side of the glass building in the center of the square, a long opening spands. It's length a long sprint and height five times the height of Guile. At the top of the enteracne hang tapestry pictures of actual sized warriors staring down at those who enter.

Love leads, and they enter the building through the opening.

People wearing gold and shining rocks stand in robes and stares. Soldiers wearing black and red stand by a black box. A few warriors wearing shoulder armor, breast platens, sweat and cuts standd and flex as people wearing white robes and gold point at the warrior muscles and armor.

Love leads to stairs. 

The stairs split: up and down.

Love leads down. 

Guile sweats and quick steps down. >We in gladiator build?< 

>We are inside the dome and the pit,< Love sees.

Id and orgres wearing blood stained leathers and heads hung drag feel up the stairs as Guile skips down. 

the wide stairs step down to a glass floor that spands wide and far. Pillars rise from the floors to the ceiling three times the heigh of guile. 

The pillars have dark doors that caste away with light shining from hovering globes reveaing stairs.

People step into the pillars and walks the spiral stars. Many stand around and talk. They stare at

The people stare at the warriors. The warriors pose and talk with warriors or walk with warrior wearing stares that peer beyond. 

The warriors muscles rise and rip over tone tall bodies. Sweat gleams from the hoving ball of lights. 

Warriors big and fat with arma as big as tree trees raise swords and roar with the clapp and chatter of hugoblins, humans, elves, gnomes all speaking the surface talk.

>Does Senator Ring own warriors,< sees Guile.

>Senator Ring controls warriors and soldiers. WE own gladiators. I own twenty of our gladiator. Those who where your pack are now my gladiators fighting to earn their freedom.<

>I pay with troll death moan. They pay with winnings,< sees Guile.

People begin to walk from the pilliar doors in the ceneter of the wide and feeling endless room. The people walk in  long lines. The walk past and behond Love and Giule while talking murmur and click and claks. Their hands shakes and swing and punch. 

One shouts, ,,REDDDDDDDDD KILLLLLLLER!''

A few boo from a distant group walking the smae bath.

>We chnage fight. We help warriors,< sees Guile.

>You silence mind< Love leads in silence with the soldiers create a circle around.

Guile quicks steps and huffs, wipes sweat from forehead, looks at Love.

They walk by groups and pairs of people awalking from the center pillar stiars. They walk over a glass floor smeared and stained brown and blows. Pieces of leather and paper are kicked around. A wooden cub is crushed unders a soldiers step. They walk to the far side where a wide.

The soliders stop near a pillar. 

Love walks into the pillar door and down the spiral stairs in the glass piller.

Guile follows. 

Love sees, >You live amoung cleaners. YOu are hired as a cleaner. You will work with my team of three cleaner to clean the arena after our fighs. You will clean the waiting are after the warriors. You will help clean the bleechers at the end of the day. YOu will receive command from me. I see your mind for you are of the hive. You think of me and I will see.<<

>Others see thoughts?< sees Guile. 

Love sees. >They see your through to me. They do not see my thought to you. They do no read your mind unless they are of the hive. Your mind has the protection of the hive.

Guile shuffles down the steps. >How many see in the city.<

Love strides down. >Many mind see beyond. Our mind is strongest.<

Door open to halls of light and darkness. The soldiers walk before love and stand by the doors preventing people from entering. 

Guile walks next to love.

The walk a few hallways with gray suited elves and gnomse standing near the stairs, watching Love and Guile and the guards pass, holding buckets and mops.

Light glows from the walls of the stairs.

Guile leads the walk down feel a pull to step along the base to steps down the stairs. Guile feels a purr spread from head to spin.

The purr flows through Guile's spine and tingles the goes to step down.

They  walk down stairs by gray body suit wearing humans, elves, gnomes and a few goblins.

The gray suited workers press bodies againsts wall and slide past Love, Guile and the soldiers as they walk up. up the wall andup the wall.

A soldier of purple and yellow slaps a halfing in gray suit and carrying a bucket.

Soldiers click and clack.

Guile steps, feels the purr calm. The tinkle of hands fade.

The soldiers silence, steps and march after Love.

Guile feels the purr, and the purr flows through guild guiding for to step donw adn down.

The purr through Guile.

Guile peers at the gray sheets. He shouts from his mind and feel the echos of clicks and clacks. He hears the pacs and song of the talk and see through goblin's mind, but the purr vibrates Guile away and to is body and from teh stairs.

Guile leads Love and the soldeiers along a narrow hall. Guile follows a purr that flows through the halls.

Light shines from globes long the top of the hall and over doors and through the walls. Small balls of light shine through the wall illimnating sihlouettes of talbes and chairs and behings sitting and sleeping.

Gray sheet workers step and run along the hall to stop into door ways.

Doors line the hall ever ten steps. The doors a two heads taller than guile and as wide. Their glass surface purrs into room. ten steps wind and big. Gray sheets sit and lay on glass beds and chairs.

Guile steps to a way.

A door that opens in is open to a room

The room is a tens step wide room with glass walls. Four balls of light float in the four corners. Light shines over a glass bed to one side. Sheets and blankes lay folded on a billow. Two gray body suits hang to the other die. In the corner, by the body suites there is a metal lever sticking from the wall above a bowl. 

Guile steps into the room. 

The lights brighten. 

A water drip drops from a hole the corner to the bowl below.

>I in my room,< sees Guile. >I wear the gray sheet.<

Love steps behind Guile.

The soldiers spread along the halls and stand with back against wall. The open doors and pushes people naked and dressed with gray jump suits. The soldiers push the people from the hall.

Guile feels the purr ripple and calm then fade.

Guile sees site in mind of a room.

The door closes.

Love sees, >You work to clean the pits, the hallds and the beechers above. You are a cleaner. You will be given a puckes, a mop and towels. YOu will wake from light and work until it is dark.< The purr flow from fingers and through Guil'e body and minds.

Guile's skin raises bumps and shivers from tickle chills. 

Love sees, >|You will not leave this compound or building. You will see the minds and find all the secrets. You will learn their minds to find their bodies to control. You will see those here like you and hide from them. You will not see the hive mind, but the hive mind will see you.<

Guile sees, >You want me find secrets and paths through people's mind. You want help with the politics and the standing of Senator Ring.<

>Yes,< sees Love.

Guile looks around room. >You punish me for killing. You train me for control. You humilate me for amusedment.<

You will be given privledge to control all the mind you can see.< Love walks to the bowl in the corner and looks up then down. >|You can drain this place of all though if you wish.< She steps and looks at Guile. >|You will be on your own.<

Guild burps and sniff. >YOu give me food.<

>You eat with workers< sees Love.

>YOu help when danger,< sees Guile. 

>You will be along,< sees Love. >|We will be in your mind, but you will not be in ours.<

Guile snorts. >You give me no choise. You give me no hope. You expect acts of me.<

Love steps from the corner to the door seeing. >You will know whay you know when you need to know. You are isolated to help you learn and show you are competent.<

>I will not clean. Do it self,< sees Giule. He says, ,,This death. Bad. Gllimor!'' He steps to bed.
