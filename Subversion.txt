>William will die,< sees Love. She lowers her tapping tool and leans it agains the wall.

The crowd around the sphere claps and cheers, and a few chant, ,,WILLIAM...WILLIAM...WILLIAM...''

William stands with swords out and shield to side.

Guile mumbles, ,,You don't follow your mind at the time to find William with a pack.''

The near naked warrior jumps side to side.

Love sees, >|William will die because Senator Ring wants the glove to go to another descendant of the high priest

William ducks and punch.

The near naked warrior spin kicks and hits williams helmed head.

William stabs the near naked warrior's leg.

Guile watches the near naked warrior. >I kill Wililam.<

Love smirks. >No...No. You kill no one. William will kill self. The curse of the guantlet may spread. It's magic transfer through the mind. Carlos the Barded Dwarf created part of the guantlet with the High Priestest Westmore. Their love will curse if not through battle or self.<

Guile sees, >Westmore. William Westmore.<

>William Westmore has grand parents who are goblinkin.<

William swings sword and slashes chest of near naked man.

Near naked man flips and tubmples and swing kicks Williams metal shoulder. 

The metal piece falls from shoulder.

The crowd cheers and stomps feet.

Guile sees, >How often the fight.<

>Every ten cycles.<

Guile looks at Flare. >Ten cycles. William fights now. Night after Love attacked. Days after control mind to fight. Now.<

Flare looks from Sphere to Guile. >It's not coincidence.< Love looks to the sphere. >|I would have sent the gray to kill Flare when time could lead to this event.<

>When kill me?< sees Guile.

>When you are no longer loyal to the Mind Trust,< Love looks from the sphere and William to Guile. >|We may kill you.< She looks at William. >|Flare would have leaft with the pack had she not been caught with the pack. She was part of the resistence. John the Goblinkin wanted sex with Flare. Sex blinds many.<

William bashes shield against the near naked warrior's face. Spit and blood flye.

Guile think. <You do not follow your mind at the time to find William with a pack.>

The near naked human's fists double bunch William's chest.

William stumbles back.

Guie sees, >What need to do?<

>YOu need to help your pack travel the desert. You help the mind trust with the wererats being created by Spear,< sees Love.

Guile see, >They know spear is were.< He looks over the crowd clapping and stomping.

>They believe Spear is an animal.<

William swings sword, and the near naked man ducks.

>|We have bought the infected. They will be transport across the desert with you caravan and your pack.<

Guile snorts.

The near naked man icks and spin bunches. Williamd steps back and bashes shield against face.

>You pack Guile. You pack of were to take to the binary city.<

>Two cities.<

>There are two cities,< sees Love. >One ruled by the mind and the other ruled by the magic. The magic is both divine and archane. It is the magic the were will stop.

It is the soul the were will corrupt. it is the were we can learn to control with a leader.<

William hits sword agianst the arm of near naked warrrios and cuts it at elbow.

>William,< sees Guile.

>You are their leader,< sees Love.

Guile stares at the nake warrior grabbing arm. Arm bleeds andn blood pools.

The near naked man spins kicks and sips in blood.

Guile sees, >Not a leader.<

The crowds stomps and claps. ,,WILLIAM WESTMORE. WILLIAM WESTMORE. WILLIAM WESTMORE.''

Love sees and stares at the globe. >You can be. A leader of rats who knows the mind of the beings.<

''WILLIAM WESTMORE. WILLIAM WESTMORE. WILLIAM WESTMORE.''

Guile stares at William.

Williams steps to the dark bottom of the globe and begins to lowers.

Once his head dips blows the darkness, the globe begins to shift and turn.

>Why the guantlet?< sees Guile. 

Love sees, >The guantlet will help find destroy the High Priest of the Binary City to the Rise and through the canyon.<

>The high priest ruler of domain?<

>She is ruler of the church of churches. The church of chuches controls the power. The archine has no power for they are few.< Love sips wine.

The sphere rolls. The near nake huma boy rolls and drops itnot he dark hole.

Guile chews beef strips, sees, >How many now about the rulers of city?<

Love purrs, >Everyone of the empire knows the plance of power. They know the psionic and engineers created the machines that buildt the tunnedls and paths through the canyon between the cities.<

Guile swallows. >Who controls warriors?<

>the priests and wizard control the army with Gods.<

Two gray sheets rise from the darkness at teh bottom of sphere. They hold buckets and brooms.

>How many know the two cities are at war?<

>All of the realm know of the war. These people starring at this sphere know of the war of power. It is what makes us strong. It makes us crazy.< Love sips wine and reaches to grab the pole leaning against the wall. >|They control the magic. We control the people.< She taps pole against the sphere. 

The people beloow begin to stomp and clap hands.

The two gray sheets mop blood from sphere.Guile sees, >What are the names of binary cities?<

>Rise,< says Love. >is the city of magic casters. Set is the city of the mind.<

Guile says, >Where I go?<

Love lowers pole at the stomping and clapping bang beat. >You and the pack go will travel to Set. You deliver the armor. You give the warriors their freedom.<

The gray sheets lift blood covered buckets and mops and stop on the dark circle.

Guile snorts, chokes, coughs. Bread bits fly and fall down to the ground.

The gray sheets lower.

Love purrs, and the tickle in Guile's through sooths and throb in head from cough numbs. Love sees. >|You will be our connection.<

>We lead to Set,< sees Guile.

>You lead to Set. You survive. You will be exposed to the Mind Trust,< sees Love.

Guile looks at Love.

Love looks at the sphere.

The stomping becomes claps.

A furry, huge head, like a giant rat appears.

The crowd cheers.

Many shouts. ,,IT IS SPEAR!''

Guile looks at the crowd below then at the giant rat in the sphere. >Spear.<

>Spear is the warrior,< sees Love.

Spear scampers along the sphere going from two to four legs. A largs red axe is mounted on back.

Guile sees. >They don't know Spear is wererat?<

Love smirks. >A few people have thought, but those thoughts have been lost.<

>|The tranfer of were?< Guile pites muffin.

An elf wearing shiny scales radiates and glimmers from the dark of the hold at the bottom and through the glass sphere.

Guile squints. >How many were created?<

>We have created twenty-five. Hundreds have been infected. >|Have you ever controlled rats with you powers? Have you ever lead rats.<

Guile looks from Spear and the glimmering lights to Love. Guile smirks. >Rodent's follow. It's the way.< Guile looks from Love to Spear. >|Can't shout or focus to caste thought when wererat.<

Spear punches shimmering elf.

Shimmering elf spins and cuts Spear. The shimmers glimmer in Guile's sight.

Guile blinks away spots.

Love sees, >YOu have a mind that splits when you become were. YOu like Spear for the Spear you know not there. The mind splite to two thoughts. The thought of the beast controls.<

Guile watches Spear.

Spear leaps and hit the glimmering beast then be stabbed.
 
The climber beast spins.

>Spear lives for the were. He is the reason William and Kirra adapted,< sees Love. >We have seen to a few victories, but their fights their own.<

Spear scampers from the shimmering blade and the shimmering armor. Blood trail follows Spear.

Guils chews piece of fat. >What do I need to do?< He spits over the edge of rail to the crowd below.

The crowd below claps and cheers. A few toss root skins against the glass sphere. Agianst the glass sphere a few stick.

The glass sphere rolls.

Inside the glass sphere, Spear leaps and the glitter and bites. The glimmer shines bright.

Guile closes eyes and lets the spots of blue and red flash through the dark. >I can kill the glimmering being.<

>You kill Spear,< sees Love.

Guile blinks eyes open. >You take me from this place, I kill.<

>You kill William,< sees Love.

Guile sniffs. >Yes.<

>You kill Kirra?< sees Love.

>Yes,< says Guile.

Spear rollos from atop the shimmer being. Shimmering elf slashe spear's shoulder.

Love grins, sips wine. >You will take the three warriors across the desert with John of the Goblinkin with a caravan train of weapons.< Love holds the glass over the floor. >|You will see for trators and keep all three warriors focused on survival.<

Guile smirks and coughs, sees. >You...They will kill John.< Guile sees to Love. >|I will kill John.<

Love peers at Guile. >You will protect John.<

>How?< sees Guile as he watches Spear.

Spear leaps and hits the shimmering being. The shimmering sword flies and slides over the dome. 

>You do what you do best.< Love stands. >You survive by controlling minds.< Love walks from the couch and behind Guile. >YOu lie.<

Guile watches Spear.

Spear scrambles around the rotating sphere.

The sphere turns and the glimmers shimmer and fade.Guile yawns. >What is the hivemind's plan.<

Love walks from couch and puts the wine glass on food table then points at the gray robed gnome.

The gray robed gnome walks the room, and the curtains begin to close.

The curtains blocks the shimmering beams as the shimmering being spins and shouts like siren above the roar of the crowd.

,,IT IS SPEAR,'' one hallors with a cheer and shouts as the curtians close.

As the curtian closes, silence spreads.

the door to the room clicks closed.

The light dims then two globes brighten.

Love walks toward Guile as Guile twistes and looks back.

She follows his stare to sit next to him.

A purr spreads through Guile. The purr shakes the sphere of the humming mind trust from mind. The purr sooth Guile's ankel pain. A Tickles sooths Guile as the thought of Spear fades to darknes.

Love sees, >The room will protect. Our hiddedn image will help hide.<

Guile feels the void of where once the mind trust seen then sees, >The mind trust not trustful.<

>The trust is too big to trust.<

>You want me to kill William for the guantlet,< sees Guile.

>No.< Love smiles. >Willliam will die during a fight. I need you to take william to Myst in the catacomes of this city where she sings with the Priests of Tone. After his body is delivered to the Myst you will find your way to Spear and Kirra in their nests. From the nest, you must convince them to follow you to Ghhrend.Ghhrend will be waiting for the four. Our contact in Tone will return William to Spear and Kirra. It is then you must both hide Kirra, Spear and William while helping them join the caravan and leave the city.<

>Why I protect the pack. They can protect themselves,< sees Guile.

>You protect the pack from the truth and the minds from mystical or mental attack.<

>Lie. Why?< Guile sniffs and clears throat. >Why they alive? You kill William.<

>I do not Kill Williams. William will kill William.<

Guile smiles. >You get the guantlet with no curse, and you raise the dead body of William. You have me protect pack across desert to free the pack.< Guile stares. >|Why?<

>One who is related to the great dragon priest of Gobly is a lich that can only be destroyed when the phylacary is destroyed. The phylacary can only be destroyed by the guantlet. The guantlet was made to destroy the phylacery. The guantlet is curse in that it can not be removed unless arm is cut or life taken. The killer will be cursed to want to wear the guantlet. The guantlet worn by one not of the blood line of The Great Dragon Priest of Gobly creates madness.<

Guile opens eyes wide, clears throat and snort. >How many other William's brother's and sister's have?<

>The relations are cousins.< Love smiles. >We have many.<

>How many will be travelling with us?< smirks Guile.

>No cousins travel with you over desert.<

>We take the guantlet?< 

>The guantelte may travel with you.<

>It can't teleport.<

>It will teleport if on a living being.<

>How you know so much about the guantelt.<

>Carlose the Barded Dwarf seen to use the details.<

Guile laughs and coughs and snorts snort. He wipes wine dripping from nose with dirty gray robe. >They never travel in caravan. They never follow me. I tell them alive and how and they won't trust me.<

Love stares. >You leave on the caravan from here only with the trio.<

Guile snorts and stares. Jaw clenches smile away. 

Love stands and Guile feels the purr flow through body. The purr grows to a sphere of sense than numbs Guile's body.

The numb feels to mummble voices tickling body. Whisper and eching laughter flow through Guile's mind.

>Mind the trust for it is your mind,< sees Love.

Guile and Love speak through minds between breath and almost between time.

Guile sees, >See with hivemind when working?< Guile feels an itching purr. Guile sees. >I see hive mind when working with gray's.<

Love sees, >You see with Hivemind if  Mind trust is near. The power of the site to be networked and linked doesn't span a desert, but nt can be found in a dream or a voice ar an act. The thoughts you see in the Mind Trust will bind you thoughts to similar near. The full mind trust can be seen if the mind's are open, but not accessible.<

Guile sees, >Will I have help trying to get the guantlet from William's hand to you.<

Love sees, >You will take the glove to me as after William's death, I will be near. You will need to be sure no other gray takes the glove away for there are many who know of the glove and want the glove.<<

Guile sees, >Who wants the glove?<

>The glove is sought by Senators, governors, wizard, engineers.<

>Glove can kill the hight priests or traded to priests. Who can I trust?<

Love smiles. >You trust me.< 

Guile nods. He looks at the gray suit standing by the door. >Who will be working?<

>you will work with YikTORitSuLe gives you to work. YikTORitSuLe is loyal only to the grays. The grays are a larger union throughout the domain of the binary realm. YikTORitSuLe would want to the glove only to hold balance between the powers. YikTORitSuLe will likely choose one to watch you. AFter the site last nigh tof Love there are eyes and mind looking into you.<

>I trust know one. Can I trust you?<

>You trust me. I will move you from this city and to a position of power.<

Guile feels the Mind trust purr fills the mind and spreads. Guile's thought span the contract away from the mind trust locking and spreading. Guile's feels caste distrust and questions, but give no idea. >You want the glove for power.<

Love grins.

Guile looks at Love. >A contract. I get a contract.<

>you will have a contract.<

>Why you don't transport Spear, William and Kirra with guantlet to fight in other gladiator rings.<

Love blinks. Her purr spreads over Guile. She sees. >When crossing a desert it is best of the slaves don't revolt. If we force them to cross the desert, they may force a revolt with the warriors. Then with the warriors with the slave. A free mind is a silent mind. You give a person the idea of freedom and you will quell descent.<

>They revolt against John the Goblinkin.<

>They revolt unless there is the idea of freedom.<

Guile siffs and rub nose. >I trust contract. Paper contract. Contract like in goblins port. Contract with deal to travel and money. Enough credit to buy house in Binary city. One Seantor ring lives. You live. A contract for a job.< He sniffs and stands.

Love stares. She smiles. Her and slides between folds of body wrap and pulls narrow long sheet of paper. >Your contract is here.< 

Guile grabs the sheet.

Rows of marks spread down the pages. Guile focus on the paper and the marks shift to form the runes of Set Mountain Dwarves.

Love sees, >You go. You read. You do or do not.<

The curtains part and the globes dim to dark.

Two gray sheet clean the blood.

The door opens and two soldiers wearign yellow studded leather and purple chain mail. The short swords and small shields shine.

>You work. You watch. You will work new places. You find away get the trio in our caravan. You will be free. you will be safe with us.<

Guile looks at the soldiers.

Love sees, >You leave.<

Guile leaves with the soldiers, down the stairs. through the room along the ahll and into his room.

Guile says with breath as feet step to and from the work, ,,You don't follow you mind during the time of finding William with a pack.''
