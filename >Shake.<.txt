>Shake,< sees a voice in Shakes mind. It's tone near a calm soothing song like talk of a poet reciting about love and loss.

<Where?> thinks Shake.

>In your head,< sees the voice.

<I'm dead,> thinks Shake.

>You are not dead,< sees the voice. The voice continues. >|Your mind is lost
to the body.<

<Where, why,> think Shake as Shake thinks to open eyes then searches for feeling and touch, smell and the force to push arms. <|I can't move.>

>Your body may move,< sees the voice.

<I CAN'T FEEL!> Shake thinks. <|WHAT ARE YOU?>

The voice sees, >Open your eyes.<

<I can't.>

>Imagine you body then make it move.<

<What?>

>Create a thought of your body.<

Shake focuses thought and sees a body.

>Move the body's arm.<

Shake's image of a body moves it's arm.

Pain strikes the dark and shatters the image the body.

The voice feels to sigh. >Again. And begin to open eyes. The site of the physical will help join body and mind.<

A body appears in Shakes thoughts. The body's head rises and eyes open.

Shake opens eyes.

A broad and stout human stands on plush pillows and by a wooden table. His broad shoulders and wide from lays naked except for tattered wool shorts. His bald body stands still with eyes closed.

,,Who are you?''

>Guile,< says Guile to Shakes mind as his eyes open to stare at Shake.
