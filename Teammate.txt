<Flare,> sees Guile. He grabs the hilt of the heart dagger. ,,You betray.''

,,I live,'' says Flare. She pulls and slides two daggers folds of the gray body suit. Leather starps wrap around shoulders, bices and forms. Lether ties wrap around thights and ankles; waist and breasts.

Guile lowers tip of dagger. ,,Living is good.'' He stands. He lays on bed. ''Sleep. Can't think.''

>I think,< sees Flare. She slides daggers into folds of gray. She steps into room and shuts the wood door. ,,I am your boss.''

,,Will boss let me sleep,'' says Guile. ''Cant'...'' He yawns.

>|I will think for you.< sees Flare. ,,You need to listen.'' She grabs Guile's foot and squeezes.

Guile pulls on foot and lays. ,,Leave. Talk when sleep.''

Flare holds Guile's foot. >|WE tallk now. You listen,< sees Flare. She says, ,,You must list to the job rules before you sleep.''

Giule lefts head and looks at Love. ,,Talk.'' He yawns and lays head on a folded sheet. He stares at the white wall. 

The lights glow and spread golden dim. 

,,You will work six light then rest for one light,'' says Flare. >|You think with me only,< sees Love.

Guile sits-up.

''You will clean the pits after the fights,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will learn to hid your thoughts from the other seeers in the crowd.<

''You will clean the wait room,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will be killed if you are caught.<

''You will live here,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will learn how to control your through or die.<

''You will work to pay off your debt to Senator Ring,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will be given tasks by me.<

''You will be paid through your cube,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will be rewarded with power and control.<

''You will obey or you will fire,'' says Flare. Flare sees, >|You will hide your thoughts and mind or you will be killed.<

''I am wateching. I will not allow you to ruin the name of the gray's or Senatro Ring,'' says Flare. Flare Sees, >|You will not see or think of Senator Ring or Love or any being you know.<

Guile stares.

Flare ,,This is our playing field. We are a team. Everyone else are the opponents. After your sleep I will show you your job.''
