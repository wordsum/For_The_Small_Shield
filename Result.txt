The shadows extend from the dark through the twinkling light. 

The siren sounds of a song spread through the tunnel.

Pain sing through ears and brain through the spine and neck. Muscles pulls and cramp around spines. 

Spear kick and circle and presses ear to the gound.

Kirra presses palns of ears.

Myst hears the warning of doom and hums. 

The hum sooths Kirra and Spear's spine pain.

Guile sees away the sound and steps.

A shadow arm reaches from the dark and swipes a robe being sitting by a shining dance of lights through the water.

Shadows grab a couple robed being sitting a stones through from the pack.

The pack feels their head pain sooth as Myst's hum spread through mind.

The peircing alarm spread through the tunnels.

Robed beings of Reighn run along the tunnel from the dark, past the pack and to the dark.

Spear runs past the running robes and leads at the shadow creatures.

,,Shadow soliders,'' says William. He clenches his steel hand pulls his sword from sheath.

Kirra pulls her blades from scabbards.

,,SPEAR,'' shouts Myst.

Her shout quiets the ringing waring.

Spear feels a claw scrape back. He swats paw. Paw slows and becomes dark the then light.

Light shines through the tunnel as if it were day. The tunnel spans with stream floating into a larger room and a pool of water.

By the stream near the pack, five Shadow Sholiders stand like shadows then stretch toward the pack. One shadow wraps arms around Spear and pulls him along the hall.

Along the hall, robes run from the shadows soldiers and robes run to the shadows creatures. They foots stpes fall and in pace with Myst drum beat.

Myst beats her drum and hums.

The shadows soldiers stetech and span along hall, away from the packe. The Shadow Soldiers hold Spear pulls Spear toward the water.

Spear wiggles and squirms large body from shadow arms and bites and swipes. Bits of shadow spread and fade in the light.

The dark arms around Spear snap back to humoind sized body and few leaps away.

Spear leaps aways.

As Spear leaps, Myst pound drum with on hand and points open palm the Shadow Soldiers. William and Kirra rush at the Shadow Soldiers with the three robed beings. Guile mental shout and hears the echoes of >To the death of that which is dark. ...Retreat? Are there more on way?... ...10...GO... Sun light shines through valley... Where's Glien, Where's Client. ...Ka Takik KiQuaKoJik...<

Guile grabs Heart Dagger and steps along side. Myst.

Myst hits drum.

Drum beats pound through hall.

The shadows ripple and spread, expand from a shadow figure to a shadow streteching away from the pack, drums and rushing.

A few shadows arms reach with claws that spread along the floor adn up the legs of William and two of the running ribes.

William feels a force grabs knee and twist. He stumbles. He hits one in a robe. He slashs sword at the floor, and the sword swipes through the shadow.

One in a rob is pulled to the ground and hits with the thumb.

Another in a robe raises arm and whistles.

The third in a robe kneels by the fall as a shadow hand wraps around the hood and twists the head of the fallen. 

Kirra throws her red dagger at the shadow arm extending.

The dagger hits the ground, cracks the glass and stabs the shadow, and the shadow around the robe priest fades, and the shadow arm contracts to the shadow being one leap away.

Kirra leaps, pulling blades short swords and slashing. Short swords slash a shadow in half.

A body in black body suit appears. The throat bleeds.

Kirra hits the body, and a body falls.

William stabs and slashes with shining sword. The slash cuts a pices of shadow adn that piece fades.

The slashed soliders stretches an spans from the light to the dark in the distant. It's body shakes with Myst's drum beat.

,,FFFFFFFFAALLLLLLLLLLL,'' say Myst holding the not as the third shadow soldier flies away from William and Kirra from the lights.

The shadow soldiers stretch away like a band pulled toward the distant dark.

Spear leaps over Kirra and William toward the dark.

William swipes shinning silver steel sword at the legs of an extending shadow. ONe leg snaps and puffs to lights of day giving no shadows.

Kirra stices at the dark shaps as it is sent awa\ thitting a tense mass that bleed dark.

A dead body falls to ground. The dead body dressed in black branching like armor lays a few steps from Kirra.

Kirra raises dagger.

Myst sings. ,,We be seen to shine beyond this hall to the people where teh shadows are held back by the light and the fright of the many eyes of People.

Kirra stabs the throat of the body whear tight black suit laying on ground.

The body gasps. and grips Kirrra.

Kirra feels a shock of cold. She jumps to feet pulling Red Dagger from throat.

A stream of blood squirts from neck of shadow soldiers.

Wililam steps toward the darkness, and hears Myst. The song plays for Wiliams pumping heart to slow to the beat and stop the run then back step toward Myst. He song shouts, ,,We have time to fight. Now we don't take flight. We find the path of right.''

Near the dark, Spear slows the rush. He feels William song and raises to hind legs to run long strides to William. He scapers to William and Myst from the dark.

Guile says, ,,We go to the surface.'' He back steps to Myst. ''Where the shadow soldiers come?''

Myst steps and says, ,,The prime plane and the shadow plane beyond the dark.'' She steps and hums low and deep. She quick steps then runs through hall and along nods.

Guile jogs along side Myst and says between snorts and wheeze. ,,Who controls the shadow...''

Myst hums and talks and quick steps to a jog. She steps and hums low and deep. She says, ,,The magic controls the shadow soldiers.'' She steps through the light like day and to the node with pountain and pool on the top of a mound of glass.

William jogs holding hilt and glancing back at the darkness. He looks forward. ,,We leave for the caravan now. We purchase food and water, a crart if needed, to haul our food. Then we make haste to find Ghrend and make our way from this place and these shadow beasts.''

The pack follows Myst.

The day like light becomes dark like night with twinkles of light guilding and showing hte path of streams and pools.

The water guilds the pack through two hill nodes and fountains and three halls with streams flowling along the middle and twinkling lights shining. Cold fumes of mint chill the skin.

A hum spread around as robed behings hum.

Robed beings stands still along the river's edge, sit calm in center or walk way.

The pack runs around.

The walk and dance as the hum become a one with beats and thuds with a chior of tuned shouts rising with stings. 

Sound pounds from a node adn around found.

The pack follows Myst into the dance. 

Myst steps fast and spins around, hits the drum and follows the hit with a roll and tap as William stumbles through, but hears the beat of Myst and feels the beat of Myt to tun true through the nod with the pack.

The pack follows Myst along a hall and must slow run to a walk with hand pounding drum beat the rolls to her hum as she grabs into darkness along the wall. She grabs a ladder rung and climbs.

The pack follow her body and hum as Myst sees her way up.

Spear follows with paw hands holding the later following Kirra who follows Guile who follow Wiliam who follow Myst.

Myst climbs following the hum sight she sees the ladder. With the song she sees and feels the light shind from a hold above. She hears the song of Rieghn whistle. Her mouth flows with the whislte song in mind and whistels her hum. 

The light shines, they climb.

Guile heaves and snot drips. 

Kirra pushes him up the ladder.

A sound of munning that rises and lowers slow and steady like the distant sound of wind through a canyon.

Myst climbe the ladder to hole, light and a room full of gray, white, place, read, brown, purple, pink and blue robed beings sitting on floor and writing on parchment. The parcment lays on boards.

A wood floor with smooth slats spans around to a wood room. Wood walls rise twice the height of Myst to a wood ceiling.

Myst humms, and her humm sings with the writers in the room as se stesp a path to a door.

William steps and clashes with a hum.

No hoods rise to glance or peak. The hum sound peacks and one bangs agains the wood ground.

Guile queeze and tumbles to a slow walk fater Wililam.

Kirra steps from Hole when Myst opens door.

Papers hanging from wall with marks and lines flaps and flutter opening to a hall.

Spear leaps from hole an on hind legs with a bang. 

The bang hist past of the beat agains the floor and the hum in the hair of the large box of a room.

Myst leads the noise bad through mint fuming hall of wood and dim lights. 

the boords creak and band as they step fast. 

A few doors. A robe stands and stares with robe and sound gretting the passing band. 

The band plays sounds and a song to Myst. The song to Myst rises and lowers from the Wax, Wane, Rise and Set guiding her along the hall to to the Wax into a largr and talk  room with a bleececer ring from a senter pit.

The runn itnothe pit with wood foor and tands and chairs scatterd. 

Beings with chain mail rise swords and sing a lower BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA note. They stand from podiums around the stairs that ascend to the doord where more chain mail wearing soldiers stands. Their armor twinkles and glimmers with the hovering golden lights. The twinkle twists like with a their. ''BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH...'' Ton es as all sing stare and step.

The BAAAAAAAAAAAAAA sound is hear by Myst. IN Myst, the sound become words for Back. She sings, ,,Back for our path leads a song.'' She rund toward two of the guards standing eithe rside of a wooden stairs leading step and hight to a door wat and two more chain mail soldiers of hugoblins race.

The soldiers below, above and around step back to dustless spots and watch the pack follow Myst.

Myst leads the pack through the door, grand all to large double door doorway.

Light shines through doorway.

Through door way, they run into people.

A bazzar spread around the pack and through the smells of smoke hung around heads and bodies. Bells clang and cows moo. A few pigs oil in parse. 

Poeple stand and talk and piont at knives and pans; pig and goats, shirts and boots along booths and blankets. 

The bazaar spanes a vaste open ear in the center of tall glass buildings rising to a bright light blinding a light blue. 

The sounds of the bizaar clash with the pace of Myst's beat and song on her mind. 

The pack stumbles and gathers around s circle.

Guile coughs and spits snott and heaves.

William stands, and shoulder bumps a hunched hugoblins carrying plets over back and limpy leg. William steps toward the ground and lays hand on hilt. 

Guile coughs.

Myst says loud over the talk, the rapping of prices, clicks and clack, drum circles and singers casting voice for money. ,,REIGHN LEADS HERE. THE SONG TOO STRONG TO HEAR IT'S WITH A TONE SONG.'' 

William looks over the headds of the people and to Spear and Kirra. ,,This is the bazaar with Ghrend selling wears. We should buy food and water for the trip.''

Guile sniffs. ,,We take wagon and join carvan. Sneak on?''

William points steel finger at Guile. ,,You will help us join the caravan.''

Guile stares at William.

William glances from William to Kirra and Spear. 

Spear stands on hind legs and paws look more like hands. His fur is short like lots of hair. His snout still sticks and ponts. The wshipers like like hair. He sniffs and wiggles nose. 

,,Kirra,'' says William. 

Kirra steps to the crowd. ,,FOLLOW.''

Spear falls on all fours and walks then rises to hind legs and walk. 

,,WE NEED A ROBE,'' shouts Guile. ''SPEAR!''

,,HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO BE COME HUMAN?'' says William as they walk.

,,Why now?'' says Kirra looking at Guile.

Guile sniffs. ,,Don't know. Mind Trust keeping him animal. Lost self now finds self. Many reasons. No born wererat. Less control.'' He hacks a cough.

Dust spreads from a gust caste by a bard that lifts a ballon into the air.

William puts arm around Guile. ,,Where's are those cubes that control the money of this city?''

Guile grabs his cube and the cube of Flare. A cube warms in hand, and he give's Flare's cube to Wiliam.

William clenches steel fist aorund cube. A warm heat spread through the steel hand. The heat spreads cools and the area of palm grabbing the cube tingles.

The look around seeing animal, hides and leather packs and saddle bags. Skins and hides hang stretchec behind booths. Bone handle daggers of sizes are arragned over wool blankets. 

,,Animal,'' says William.

Kirra shrugs and nods and steps. ,,Food. Need wagon.''

William looks around saying loud, ,,GUILE, WHEN WAS DEPARTURE OF THE CARAVAN?'' 

,,DARK!'' He covers mouth with sleeve. 

Dust clouds and stings. 

The pack press adn sthe crowd presses.

Behind wood buildings line the edige of the bazaar. The cathedrial of Rieghn rise like an A from the glass floor next to wooden shakes with tables and people eating; buildings with large doors ands stalls of animales; leantos covering forges. 

Before, people wearing faded soldier armor to holled farmer armor to robes of all colores pressa and walk. They look at the tables and plankes. The stop to talk and trade. They reachs and wave small glass cubes over the glass cube of the a seller of armor, tools, cloths and food.

As they jostle through the crowd and toward the center of the bazaar. Guile trips, and William's steel hand grabs him to a stand. Kirra leasd an elbows past hunched orcs and a group of elves wearing green leather and holding baskets of food.

Kirra stops and points to basket and speaks elf. 

A tall elf nearly the height of William holds basket away and pionts to the booths around. 

Kirra askes for a wagon, and the elf shrugs shoulders and snarls. 

The pack of elves pushes away. One points at Spear.

Spear changes as he stands. His hair falls and lays. It seeps into body and his fingers and arms pop and shift with contacting muscles.

Kirra looks at Spear and peers at William.

William says near Guile, ,,We need you to give you Robe of Rieghn until we are able to find our path to cloths food and a wagon to push along.

Guile grabs his robe of Rieghn and looks at Spear.

Myst says, ,,For the song to sing, Guile, it will sing to you.''

The words spread. 

Guile feels a wash of clam and release hold on robe the pulls it off.

Spear is pushes and hits William.

Laughter and claps lead eyes to see people press against Spear to create a hole.

Spear squeeks and nods, shrugs drooping shoulders and pulls Robe of Riehn over body while glance to the open cicle of people spread.

The pack walks with the spread people.

Two hugblins wearing oversized black leahter armor and wire shirts swat with wooden sword and shields at each other. One stumbles over another as another swings wood sword and hits self.

The crowd claps and laughs.

Kirra pushes and steps and leads the line of the back near the center by a pavillion squire where Ghhrendle's pavillion rises and coveres a wide area.Guards wearing purple leather and yellow chained shirts stand around three wagons covered with tarps. Guards stand with swords drawn around a few dwarves wearing overalls and braided breards.

Ten dwarves with battle axes stand near the bulls harnessed to the wagons. The bulls bluster and smear bullshit over the glass ground. The wagon wheels creeak, and a dward grabs the horn of the bull and shakes the head spatting the dwarven, ,,Gooolo Kaaaa. Gooolo Kaaaa.'' The dwarf holds the horn.

,,Goooolo Kaaaaaaaaaa,'' shouts a stound and round like a big muscles under hair and beard. "GRRRRRRLRA.'' The dwarve shouts, and his beards shakes and feet pound the ground. His soot stained hide coat bends at worn creases. Hairy fingers grabs a thick black belt around waist. He pushes down on belt letting big belly plop over. He says with surface talk. ''Tied down the great. Check the knots. Eat your food. We have a caravan to meet!''

The guards shuffle and step and step away from bulls and carts as hide dressed meet pull on ropes and knots.

William steps back to the pack as the pack settles and stands. William hears the ambient drum pounds and murmurs clink with the rattled armor create a song. From that song he feels a beat for speech. He rests a hand high on Spear's shoulders and says. ,,My friend Spear, keep the hood pulled tight for they may not see what is right as being wrong for they no mind.'' William steps. ''We need food and a cart and a watch for our caravan.''

Guile sniffs and rubs nose with sleeve of branching armor. ,,I watch.''

,,And I will sing a hum to watch the way and sing you a trail to follow if the wagons spin away,'' says Myst.

William smiles, ,,Then Kirra, Spear and me shall see and find the food to get for our journey...'' He smiles.

Guile sneezes. ,,Shadow soldiers.''

Wiliam looks over shoulders at Kirra.

Kirra says, ,,Too much light.''

Myst sings, ,,There are too many people for the soldiers to hide and not fright.''

William nods. ,,How shall we pay for our wares.'' William looks at Guile. ''With a cube? Or with coin?''

,,Cube,'' says Guile. He pulls Flare's cube from pocket and pinches it before William. ''Coins maybe used later?''

William takes the cube and holds the cube. ,,And with this cube how much coin do I have?''

Guile grins. ,,I hope enough for a cart.''

William clenches the cube, ,,I believe hope will not purchase a cart if we have not enough cube coin.''

Guile sniffs and pulls his cube from pocket. ,,This.''

William takes cube.

Kirra says, ,,Have coin and gems.''

William nods and shrugs shoulders.

A bulls kicks a wagon! Armorm clashes to ground!

,,Go now,'' says Kirra.

Myst whistled like a bird and flaps wings away.

William smiles and leads with tune of Myst in the mind through the people to smells. He watches a hugoblins wering hide and overalls, pants and blouses, cloacks and cps walk everywhere. An old hugobins with hunchec back and height as tall as William pulls an empty hand cart.

William steps tin the old hugoblins path. ,,Sir, I admire your cart.''

The old being raises his head and shoulders standing a head taller than William. It's nearly square jaw flexes muscles pulling tight wrinkled skin. A click comes forth the flow surface talk. ,,You like the cart.'' His hands grip the carts poles. He lower head bending neck. His steps dragging worn hide pant sgains ground. He pulls and the wagon rolls

People step around.

William hits teh shojlder of an orc walking with the hugoblins.

The orc grunts and walk on. A few hugoblins with orc sneer at William.

William feels heart beat and hand clench then a song sooths and sings with the drums and a yelling of the ground. ,,Where shall we find a cart and food?''

Spear sniff and spoints his paw hand near the wooden buiding of Reighn.

,,A cart?'' says William. He says louds. ''I seek a cart to carry much food and water.''

William steps and leads Kirr and Spear.

Spear's legs and arms shift and muscles pulls. Pains spread, and Spear squeaks a roar of.

Kirra looks at Spear alogn with a few farmers pulling bags of grain over the sand covered glass floor.

William shouts loud, ,,I AM IN NEED OF A CART!''

William's shout carries over the chatter, clicks and shouts to myst.

Myst hears William's shout a a whsiper with the song that defines the people standing, waching and working.

Myst and Guile stands and watch. The sound from Myst's body vibrates the people and the smoke and with the sounds to show Myst all the beings around without the use of sight.

Guile looks at Myst's acid and flame melted face. ,,You see...''

,,Reighn give me sight with sound.'' Myst hums to silence and lets the sounds of those around form the images and movement. 

Guile sniffs and stands. He scratches shoulders and presses on ankle pain. The pain is sharp then numbs to dull as he stands and watches the wagons.

The armor is tied and secured. Two of the smitthies grab a horn  of a the kick bull.

Ten bulls are harnessed to ten carts. Two fo the carts are empty. Seven are covered with a pile riseing above the wooden sides of large wagons. One is half full with one dwarf on wagon shiffting and pulling on piles of gladiator armor wrappend in suits and weapong type bundles. 

Guile and Myst watch. 

The armor is piled and covered. The gruff dwarf and muscles hugoblins covered with hide coat and pants walk to an empty wagong. 

The full wagon pulls away. A few guards gather around the cart. Two dwarves with axes and breast plates pull on ropes and chaings, the harness and yoke on bull.

Wiffs off shit and bovine sweat smears through air and over the glass.

A dwart drabs an hail bail from the tent and spreads the hay before the bulls.

Straw dust floats, and Guile sneezes.

Guile feels the purr through mind. He feels the dull pain on ankel, focses though and spreads the pain through the purr and sees a in the pain a mazes ofpeople setting them selves around. He sniffs, says, ,,Can you see William and Spear?''

Myst inhale and hears all the noise and exhales sound until she hears...

William shouts far from Myst and Guile. ,,I BUY A CART. I BUY FOOD.''

William steps and walks a path through the middle.

A child hugoblins wearing red cotton shirt and pants press from between a tight walking group and cape wearing women. Hugoblns child grabs William's flesh hand and pulls. ,,WE SALE CART TO YOU! WE SEE FOO!'' He pulls on hand and William's arm. ''WE SALE CART TO YOU!'' William glance and Kirra.

Kirra shrugs shoulder and nods head back.

Spear steps after kid. 

William follows with flesh hand held by the kid.

The kid pulls William's hand from mass of jostling people; to the edge of the crowd along a row of carts and rugs and pots and pants with people shouting and point. The kid leads William along a wide path witha few people. 

The carts become small stands by stacks of blankets, anvils, yokes, glass wheels, glass boards, glass tables, glass chairs. The wears shelvers and tabales are stacked in pyramids and piles. 

Afew people walk the land. A couple of robed hugboins pionts and stare at pieces.

The kid pulls William's hand to a row of glass pull carts.

Each glass pull cart has two large wheels. two ling pulls attacked to a glass base and glass walls. The three walls and base of cart are fused to gether like one piece.

A fat hugoblins wearing a long hide coat that droops to kneeds over brown hide pants steps from a samml leanto. The leanto coveres a table with a caraffe and glasses on top. The fat hugoblins says with click free surface talk. ,,Grean,'' he nods. ''This is my son, Jilt.'' Grean's green eyes glare at William and calm. Grean's cheeks dimple with smile and face looks more human than sloped and square like a goblins. ''You want a cart?''

William grips cube of Flare's Cube. ,,I seek a cart to travel across the desert.''

Grean rests the a hand on the side of a cart. He kicks the tire. ''The will roll through the desert, jungle. You could roll this through the moutains.''

William huffs and rub the smooth glass cart. ,,I feel the craftman's ship, but it is only clase.'' He looks at the hugoblins and feels a rage that cleches his jaw. ''You have anything with wood?''

Grean peers then smiles. ,,Son, get me the hammer.''

The young goblins runs between the carts of yellow, green and black glass. He returns dragging a sledge hammar.

Grean grabs the sledge hammar with one then two hand. 

The body steps ack, and Grean swings.

The hammar thunks the tire. 

,,Cart has no cracks.'' Grean points and smiles.

William grabs the slegde hammar and slames the hammer against wheel.

The slege hammar thunks and handle vibrates.

William drops the hammar and peers at wheel. ,,No cracks.''

,,Grean's Glass is strong. Like Lava Glass.'' Grean pads the side of cart. ''It's smooth onside and roung on bottom.'' He slaps hands together and clasps hands. ''The bottom grips the haul.''

,,We have a quest across the desert and need a cart to haul the food and water to keep us feed and watered,'' says William.

As William speaks Spear feels a soldier near peering at them. Spear sees four soldiers snading near a stand of glass pots and pans.

The soldiers's glance and mummble. One nods head at Kirra an Spear.

Kirra sees the soldiers walk to the pot before William talks with the Grean. They stop and Kirra flexes wrist to pop the strab over her wrist sheeth holding knife. She glances at Spear.

Spear glances at Kirra.

Kirra sees before William ends his talk, Spear look back from under the hood.

Then William stops the talk, and Grean clicks mouth and says. ,,10,000 credit.''

William stands. He gribs the Flare's cube and says, ,,I...I will go...'' William looks around. ''10,000?''

,,You create cart of strong glass.'' says Grean. He folds arema and stares.

,,You're price for the area is a large price.'' He peers at Grean.

Kirra looks at Grean and steps and kicks the whell. Her foot rings.

Grean stpes back and lowers arm near a dagger held by belt.

,,Good for desert.'' She steps and peers at Grean. ''What if break?'' She sees the soldiers grab sword hilts. She steps to Grean and folds arms and peers. ''It gets stuck and broke.''

Grrean glances at the guards and looks a Kirra. He nods. ,,7,500 and two wheels.'' He glances at the the kid.

the kid nods and runs.

,,You take the desert raod to rise. The wogon won't new wheels.'' He steps back and lets arms fall. ''You pay.'' He glances at the soldiers, William and Spear.

William says and holds Flare's cube before Grean. ,,I have hear a cube with coin...'' He pauses, but doesn't flich. ''Credit for the cots.

Soldiers step from pots and pans. Their hands rest on hilts. They follow one holding a steel small shield while the other thold three.

Grean grabs the cube from William and nods at the soldiers. 

The soldier with the steel shield nods at Grean. The soldiers walk past.

Spear feels their stares. He stiffs and wiffs fuses of meat and root burning. He feels a wave of energy swirl and span. 

Kirra steps from Grean.

Grean steps from the wagons tapping Flare's cube a few times on the side of wagon before walking away.

Kirra snaps the sheath on forarm closed and says, ,,Credit.'' She snorts, ''Where's Myst?'' and steps on the wagon wheel and rises to see above the heads and booths of the bizaar.

The haads of the bizaar duck, bop and nod along the vaste open area. Hats, caps and coif pull over big and small heads. Heads of human, orc, dwarf, elf and id dot through the dark to light green faces of goblinkin. Hugoblins span as wide as the bright light and smoke wearing anything from caps, to hemls to a ball an hairy heads. Jet black hairs spread over the biz.

Hugoblins, hobgoblins and entgoblins wear cloakc, capes, shirts, jackets, hats, scarfs, gloves. Goblinkin dance, single, clap and snap. Goblinkin walk paths and rows and clumps of booths of glass. The tops are covered with sighns showing pictures, surface talk and markings. Ribbons are tied around poles that hold flags with images of hammars, flames, bottles and caskets. The booths span to tall and wide tents and pavillions with flags. One flag flies a black anvil on red.

Around the pavillion with the red flag rise the tips of piles of armor covered with tan hide  and pulled down by chains. A warrior dwarf with battle axe strapped to back pulls and a chain.

Kirra jumps down. ,,Myst not far.''

Myst stands by Guile a stone's throw from the first of ten wood wagins stacked with gladiator weapons and armor. She hums and and feels the stare of Reighn aourn neck warm her breasts, body. She hums and stands.

Guile stands and rubs and itch on wrist and presses on ankle. He places the pulses of sensation, the itches and the throbs of pain from ankle through a the Purr of Mind Trust. He stands with Myst.

The stand until only one large wood wagon is empty. The rests are held by oxen. Two dwarves and three hugoblins walk to wagon and haul bundled breats plates and heavy swords from the pavillion.

Ghrend stands with folded arms by the pavillion opening.

Guile sniffs.

They stnad and watch.

Myst hums. The Stare of Reighn warm.

Guile feels the warm that doesn't heat or cool, but spreads through body like a tuning fork vibration the numbs the Mind Trust Purr and the throb in angle. Guile's nose drip stops and throat vibrates a cool.

They stand with in the hum until armor bundles covere the wood wagon bottom.

Myst hums and sings with Reighn's song in mind changing the pitch and tones.

Guile listens and watches and mazes the sounds and feeling from body as a maze awa\ from the Mind Trust.

Then! A hand grabs Guile's wrist.

Two hugoblins wearing brown clocks and hoods over heads. The cloaks sway and show Faded red leather armor and belts with many dives and a blow gun.

Myst stands and sees through the hum.

Guile mental shouts and pulls arm from graps. He stares and sweaty hair shand to side of head.

The hugoblin hand gripping wrist holds Guile as guile pulls.

The other theif stesp between Guile and the amrom

,,where you get the cloak,'' says the hugoblins grabbing guile.

Guile feels the rage, paranoina, fear and bliss shout from the hugoblins through Guile. Guile feels the fear and says, ,,You don't want to know.'' He peers. ''YOu don't need to know.'' He holds body from coughing to sooth the tickle in throat.

An ox blusters and jerks aon chains. A few dwarves shout and hugoblins cliks.

Myst hums and sees to two cleacked beings and spreads the song of Reighn.

guile sees with the song and feels the fear and flows into the mind with a moan of Trool. ,,YOu drop my hand.'' Guile peers beneath the sweaty brow.

The hugoblisn termors and release wrist  and steps from Guile.

The human looks back at the bulls and ox.

Myst feels the troll moan from the song of Reighn and vibrates throat around the two, and she sings, ,,Be gone or you will Branch no where.''
Guile peers.

And the hugoblin drops Guile's arm and steps away.

Guile ppers through the hood and feels fear of guard and the soldiers. Guile sees trying to sing with the song form Myst, >You will drop your cloak and walk away. You see and feel nothing and walk nowhere.<

For an instant, the hugoblins pauses body, raises hand, clicks cloak clasp and steps from Guile and Myst then stesp from the purple and yellow armored soldiers and the carts. He pushes a few people and quick steps away.

The cloak falls.

The cloaked human watch other leave. He steps and follows looking over shoulders. He pumps into a purple and yellow armored guard.

The guard pushes him back with small shiedl and says, ,,You go where?''

The cloaked human shurgs, looks back and pushes away to a run.

The soldiers standss and watches the people part for the two rogues the the solider glances at Guile and Myst.

Guile knees with a grunt  and grabs the cloak.

The cloak's smooth leather rubs between Guile's fingers as Guile pulls the cloak and steps away.

Myst puts a hand on Myst's should and hums and calm tune and whisles like a bird searching for a mate. With the song she sings, ,,We follow the path as fast as our people will be.''

Guile sniffes and glares at the guard. He looks down and walks with Myst toward the guard and past the guard and away from the wood carts and ox.

Myst lets the lyrics singa away as they step away.

Myst's Star of Rieghn warms her chest as her song sings through Rienghn to William.

Reighn sings Myst song to William.

William hears Myst's hum.

William's Scar of Reighn carved hin his back warms and tingles through body. He says, as Kirra leps from side of wagon, ,,Myst is near and waiting. I feel hear song.''

Grean says loud as he steps around obsidian cart. ,,Empty.'' He tosses the glass cube at William.

Kirra catches the cube.

William stands ands stare. He striaghten posture and grabs Guile's cube. He tosses it at Grean.

Grean catches and give the cube to his son.

Greean's son runs around the carts.

Grean folds arms, says, ,,Whose cube is that?''

,,Our friend waiting for Ghrend to stocks the armor for the caravan gave it to pay for a cart and food,'' says William.

Ghrend spreads eyebrows and cheeks to open eyes wide. ,,Your friend...''

,,Our pack member,'' says Kirra.

Spear squeaks and says, ,,Yes.''

William glance back at Spear. He holds his form and looks at Kirra. 

Kirra peers at Grean.

Grean glances at Kirra and looks at William. ,,Where you from?''

William says, ,,The Dome and Bowl.'' He flexes his muscles.

Kirra flexes he pinky less had. Her leather strap armor stretches around tone body. Her short locks tiegh back and pulled like the edige over ofer oval eleven eyes. one a human face.

Spear steps behind William and stands a hand span above William. The hood of the robe of reighn. His face a square stone basse with jaw justted and shifting to set a block. His beard think around the saw. His larg arms set and stretche the robe of rights. The robe of right ties around his fur covered chesta and thick waists. His legs shift and set to stans a finger width above William.

Grean stares at the threes. He nods and lets arms fall. He looks back.

His son says, ,,First.''

Grean looks down. ,,Seven thousand six hundred credit.'' He holds up the glass cube of Guile's.

Grean grabs the cube. ,,You do get paid to fight in the bowl?''

William clenches steel fists and jaw. He steps and peers down at Grean.

Grean glances-up, behind and sands and steps back. ,,You need more.''

,,We have gold,'' says Wililam.

Grean laughs. ,,You lie. Where would you get gold?''

Wililam smiles.

Kirra puts hand on hilt and glaonces around the crowd.

The crowd walks and stares and glances. An id wearing long sheer rope showing naked id beneath walks with a halfling atalking fast and hgith and pointing at the wagons.

The id looks at Grean.

Grean says, ,,You have ten gold. You have this cart.'' He hits the cart side and step to the id. Grean clicks quick.

William glences fist and feels the Scar of Reighn on back itch. The itch and first strump a guitar string strums with pound of fist on drum. The song plays with a hafling saying surface talk to Grean.

The halfing says, ,,What the cost for obsidian?''

rean, witih back turned to William nods head on hunched shoulders.

Kirra slips her hand into a pouch and pulls out 10 waterdown gold. She steps to William and slides the gold into William's palm.

William says loud at Grean's back. ,,Nine gold. Nine Waterdown Gold.''

Grean looks at the halfing the id. ,,Wait for reward as I attend to this customser.'' Grean poinst along the row of clear wagosn to two black wagons at the end of the short row of carts. ''The obsidian carts are near the end. I give you credit to you if it breaks.'' Grean sturn hunchec back and stands tall at William. ''Ten gold.''

William smirks. ,,Nine. Nine for a cart, two wheels and an axle.''

Grean looks at William and glances back to the id. 
 
The id steps along the row of carts past Grean and William. The halfing glances back as she walks to a black obsidian wagon.

,,Nine gold,'' says William. He opens fist of steel to a palm of steel holding the gold.

Grean opens eyes wides then peers. ,,You nine...'' He looks at William. He smiles. He says louds, ,,FOR A WARRIOR OF THE DOME AND THE PIT I WILL TAKE NINE GOLD AND NOT TEN.'' He glancesa t the id and halfling.

The id stands and looks at a glasss wagon near. 

Grean says, ,,Second. Get wo wheels and a axles.'' Grean walk to the end of the wagon and ponts bay the side. ''See the circle and square.''

William steps, leans and peers. 

A circle within a square relief is pressed into the glass near the end of the side wall.

,,I see,'' says William.

,,You see my mark,'' syas Grean. ''I will honor our agreement.''

William shrugs and nods head back.

Grean steps back. ,,You act as if you don't care!'' He throws arms-up. ''The price is now ten gold!''

Willliam steps back. Rage spread through body and pushs at the flesh as the a faint whistle peice the rage and spread calm. William relax steel fist. ,,If you do not wish to take this money then we will be on our way to find a our wood with people I offend in ways I do not understand.'' He glances at Kirra and Spear. ''We be off.''

The son spins a wheel along ground to the wagon and lifts wheel.

Grend glances at son and looks at William. ,,You shrug at me,'' says Grean. ''Shrugs insult me. They instruct all working people.''

William peers throw wrinkled brow. ,,How did I offend you by answering your question?'' 

Grean glances at the id and looks at William. ,,You...'' He looks at the id. ''You shrug to me show me you care not.'' Grean waves the boy and pushes glass will along the bottom of the wagon. ''Nine gold buys this wagon for you.'' Grean smiles at William then looks at Spear then Kirra.

Kirra pust hand on hilt and peers at the halfing and id.  She steps behind a group of warriors wearing chainmail and red capes. Kirra steps with the groupd and jostles arounda group looking at colored glass blows on the other side of the anarrow bath between the two areas. She steps by the id and hafling with hand on hilt of sword in sheath. She pops the button strap around the hild to dagger in wrist sheath.

The id follows Kirra with eyes, but faces and rubs the glass kart before him.

The halfing puts hand on hsort swords hanging from brown belt. A scar is hidden under wrinkles ads the hafling follow Kirra. The scare under eye is revealed as she looks at Spear.

Spear stands with shadows hiding furry face adn fingers slowling shifting paws to hands. Spear feels the cal mthrough the crowd as the chaos flows and ebss through the people and hte bazaar.

William gives Greans the nine gold.

Greans says, ,,Second.'' He steps back and looks behind the row of glass wagons. ''Second! gets the two wheels and axe.'' He looks at William. ''I talk with my friends over here. Second will get you wheels, axle and writ of ownership.''

William nods. ,,We are happy you have allowed the business to proceed.'' He looks over at Kirra.

Kirra walks past the obsidian cart.

a cart with glass forks and knives hanging from a glass frame that stands like a door. 

A breeze blows a cloud of wood smoke over with distant drums and yelling voices of laughter.

The laughter plays in William's mind and William hears in the drums the sound of Myst's voice. 

A second wheel and axle are put int he back of the cart, and the son says, ,,You have your cart.'' He looks at Grean and steps to his side.

Grean rubs the side of the obsidian cart.

William grabs the cart handles and looks at Spear. ,,Shall we roll to meet Myst and leave thise place.''

Spear shrugs and nods head back. A low ,,Yes,'' speaks forth. Spear looks at Kirra then follow Willam and the cart.

Kirra stands as the cart slowly roll away.

Kirra sees the small long rows of glass ware leads to an open space full of people smoke and noise.

Flutes and strings pluck and strum fast and quick. Coumsn aof smoke swirl. People walk open space between pots of steaming meat stew and wiffs raosted Kolit flowing throw a draft.

A slight breeze gusts then lets the smells hang.

Between the sniffs of smells, Kirra sees the Id glance ater her; sees Wililam and Spear pull away; sees those two guards wearing black and red with small shiedls and short swords. They clcik and clack and look at Kirra and glance at Grean.

Kirra sniffs the smell of Grillen grilled with some dark root. Her stomach spreads a wave of holllow. She then steps and wanders along the glass bowls and plates; glass forkes and knives. She steps near the soliders, who stand by  glass shelves and glass tables. Kirra steps by a gnome lifting and looking a glass bowls. She steps a long the narrow path nudging a hugoblins wearing overalls and shaking head. She glancea t knves then forks and rods for curtains walking away from the soldiers.

The soldiers stand. They watch the id and the halfing talk with Green. 

People walk behind They stands. They walk hide grean and the soldirs. They part to show William and Spear pull with the glass cart into the crowd.

People talk surface talk with a few mummble of clicks and clacks hear through out. A few orcs grunt, but surface talk spreads around with string and flutes and a few drum pounds.

Kirra follows and watches around Spear and William a few leaps behind.

Spear leads toward the sight of pile tips of armor. He smell the burning root and the sweat of orcs standing at the end of the row of glasswares. He looks down at the ground and leads. He ppers at people passing and nudgea an orc.

The orc stand and looks at Spear.

Spear peers back and flexes massive body and steps to the orc.

William pulls the cart behind Spear and stops.

The orc, dressed in wiseal hide armor, grabs a shining short sword and wooden sheild. Big green face sneers with tussns and sweaty face.

Spear flexs and stands chest to chest with the orc. He looks down.

William release the polls of cart and says, ,,Are we going to need to show this beast how we fight?''

Another orc wearing swing hide armor, raccon tail sash and a single shoulder plate steps next to the other orc. The orc grunts and says, ,,Hummies...'' and slaps the other orcs while peering at Spear. ,,WE go.''

Both orcs stare and steps away.

People fill the viod and step around Spear and William.

Spear and William stand near.

William says, ,,I have no words or song to sing to tell of the time we have been gladatiors. I know with the new life I feel my song will sing to the sun and not this dark underground.''

Spear stands and looks as the orcs walk to away and hide in the shifting mass of people.

After a pause, Wililam says, ,,We have not found our way, and I will face our time as gladiators duirng the future, but for now I sing for Rieghn to help me entertain  a though in your mind that I am your friends and pack memeber.''

Spear glances at William, the tops of the armor wagons and the looks at the orcs' path.

William stares with Spear. ''I only hope you do not remember my acts and mind during our time being controlled by the purr song of another.''

Kirra says loud, ,,WE GO.''

Spear and William stare.

Spear inhales, shurgs and nods head back with exhale. ,,We go to Myst.'' He puts hand on William's shoulds. ''We find fate.'' He smiles. ''We leave this sand.''

William put hand on Spear's shoulder. ,,We go together to find our fates as I am and will follow you, Spear, if my feeling and visions are found to be illusions.''

Kirra sniffs, stands, says, ,,We find Myst.''

,,Myst,'' says William. He looks from Spear to Kirra and stands on tips of toes.

,,The carts are ahead.''

William grabs the cart. ,,I pull, and you lead.

,,We go,'' says Kirra.

,,To Myst,'' says William. ''To our song.''

Spear steps and leads the William and the wagon with Kirra wandering two leaps behind. 

The song leads toward the wagons.

Myst and Guile walk from the wagons of armor and away from the purple and yellow armored guards.

Myst hums and sees all around and sees through her song the balance of feeling. 

Hugoblins jaws shape between the orc big jaw with lower tusk teeth shaping slips to long forehead and the narrow jawed elf with ears pointed away from their olive eyes and endless stairs. 

Guile hears the song of myst singling and shouts along the song with his mind finding a maze through her hum into her mind and feel her thoughs as her song spreads around.

Guile is in a world of darkness with light defining the shapes for Myst as Guile sees as they walk.

Myst leads with her song through the people of goblin. Mysts song sees the people

The humans, orcs, elfs, orgs, dwarves, ids, gnomes and hugoblins walk as people. 

Hugoblins faces spread with a few orc, dwarf, id, elf, orc and humans walk in groups.

Hugoblins faces show beards as big as dwarf beards with shoulders and stalk broad and think like a dwarf. Hugoblins group walk with a few ids and walk with tow extra arms and a thin talk height. Their green skin more jaded and spreads. Hugpbins with pointed noses and hunched walk of orgs walk with a an oger through the grous.

The song sings around the people's faces to a the two soldiers of the wagons and having the oval shaped face of a human face on a hoboblin body. The people as goblins that shape and dress like the missing links between dwarves, elves, humans, orc and orgres. 

The hugoblins fill all the space between and contrast the sharp features of the all other races. 

The song sing around the people and show and feel the relation of all the being as one race connected by the goblinkin. The song sing to see that hugoblins are but one of the type of people. The humans walk wht hugoblins who walk with elfgoblins who walk with elfs who walk with elves who walk with eflgoblins who walk with orcgoblins who walk with orcs. 

Guile and Myst walk swith the song and guile feels through the song of Myst and sees through her mind to feel and see the orgins of goblins adn beings.

The song os if a bow being slowly drawn over a string like the hum of Myst's thoat and she hits a a high note. 

People who paces smile and tap a small beats away.

The song paces with the talk and the distant pounds of drums.

Myst hums and leads. Guile hears and feels.

Through the connection Guile has between their minds, Myst sees, >You dance with Reighn.<

The walk around the wide road with scattered people between a wall along the sides fo the wide glass road that leads to a center circle of swirling people. From the center circle of rolling wagons around a point lead three other roads.

Along the sides of the roads are lages tesnts, wood and steel booths and wagon carvans with awings hanging over non-glass wares. Tins of pots and pans, steel locks and iron bound wooden chests. The people stand in linesge that lead to a sheet tunnel into a a pavillion. People walk from one side of the glass road to the other leaving sand prints and pits of root shells and chicken boowns. Muggs splash drops of ale, spirits and water. Groups change and sway and sing. An elf dance away from a group of elf looking hugoblins and across the way to more people along hte side of the roads.

A wagon full of glass slats stackes and tied with rope on glass wogon is pulled by two ox along the road. People pull glass handcards loaded with class baskets of food and glass jugs of white, yellow and brown liguid.

A few goblins run along the four wagon wide road betweeen legs, under a glass cart and past Guile and Myst to the two guards wandering after Myst and Guile.

Guile and Myst walk along with the song humming with Myst. Guile feels the song spread over body through the mind. The song sooths the pain in ankle and throb in mind. The song sting pays fast and strict then fiddles a tune to a purr. The purr spreads through Guile adn through the song.

The purr covers Guile and through the maze that is the song.

Guile presses on ankle, feels a slight pain, focus on the pain. The pains respreas a maze until the purr washing over being.

Love's voice sees to Guile, >You lead the pack as it should be.<

Guile pulls mind from Myst and sees to the purr of the Mind Trust forming a Mind trust node in mind. Guile looks and peers at the people around, sees to Love, >I lead the pack to the caravan. I follow the contract terms.<

>YOu lie to pack,< sees Love as the purr feels to be a laugh.

>Truth spoke,< sees Guile. He looks behind at a group of hugoblins standing with backs facing Guile and Myst. >|You are not seen.< Guile sniffs and rubs nose. >Where is you Hivemind slave.<

>I see to the slave's mind now,< sees Love.

>You are not near,< sees Guile. He looks at the guards and stesp with Myst. >|You have a slave near.< Guile mental shout through the hive and from his mind and steps with Myst. >Nod for mindtrust like Attik.<

Myst hums and feels the tension in Guile then feels his soul's song pull its instrument from her hymn with Reighn.

The hymn of Reighn sings the creatures arua of the balance of the spheres of good and evil, law and chaos, creating spheres of emotion that change the song of Reighn in Myst's min as seh steps near. A halfing hoodling sling-staff and wearing black studded leather sings a monotone and a steady pace to show Myst the good. And orc wearing a brown robe with dropping leather backback changes the song to a quick the slow beats song with strings high and happy. The two guards wandering near Guile and Myst radiate a steady beat of deep tones that spread a few strings of hight and light whines in the song in Myst's song of Reigh. The song of Reighn plays fast, steady and deep with dark moans from Guile.

Guile steps and sniffs snott droppring from nose.. He looks at the groud behond as they cross the open road as Love purrs through Guile.

Love sees, >The caravan sees you. The caravan watches you. You need to hide and follow.<

Guile focuses away from the song of Reighn soothing the pain through his ankle. The ankle pain spreads through body and mund. The pain spreads over the purr and forms a sphere of thought.

Guile says, ,,Guards watch us. Carvan leaving. Need to find William.''

,,William,'' says Myst as the step to the crwods lining the edge of the road before three long tents and large pavilloin that spans tall, wide and long. The pavillion is full of people holding mugs

Sausge and sweat fume spread from the pavillion.

A puke covered dwarf stumbles, laughss and sqeezes between people. Pile fumes spreads.

People step from the dwarf and two soldiers. ONe soldiers is human.

Guile steps back. Myst stands and stares while shi continues her hum and step long the people standing, talking laughing, pointing, stumbling.

The dwarf stumbles at Myst.

Before the dwearf's barf beard touch Myst, who stands. A hugoblin soldiers wearing black and red swing a hook hammar at the dwarf's ankles.

Dwarf falls and puke covere beard spreads and slams against the glass floor.

Crowd parts. Mug swish ale and sprits. A few laugh. A big hugoblins with orc cheeks and brow clicks and clacks then says in surface tal, ,,DWARF CAN'T RUN.'' Other big hugoblins weariing bronze plate mail laugh and drinks. One orc standing with the orc looking hugoblins.

Myst and Guile steps away and form the edige of a cirle around the dwarf and soliders.

the guards of yellow and purlple stand at edige of spreading circle of people watching the dwarf stumble to feet, grabs hammar hooked to belt and swing wide and spin.

The black and red soldiers stand shoulder to should with small shield saftore.

The dward'fs hammer glances off shield. The hit makes thunk.

The thunk dongs on Myst's mind and echoes to Guile's song of Reighns.

Myst grabs Guile. She feels and sees through her hum and spans the path to the caravan and the pavillion then follows the thunk through the space to see a flash of the wide area, She grabs Guile, steps back and says what she sees. ,,Guards yellow purple watchi fight. Road spans Rise Set. Wagons move to us. William spear behind wagons.''

Gulie feels the pulls and lets Myst leads as he sees the maze thoughts and sensory input through the pain filter and through mind. ,,Sing way to William.''

Myst hums and grabs Guile. ,,We dance away to the other side away from the guard leading the dance of the caravan.''

Guile nods and stumbles over ankle pain. 

The hum of Myst sooths the pain.

The pains spreasd over the purr as it sooths with the hym of myst.

The hymn of Myst warm Myst's star of Reighn. The hymn of mYst tickles William scar of Reighn.

The scare of Reighn on William's back tickles and plays.

William hears a hum humming from the Rise of William's path from the rows of glass wears to a wide road mostly open with a few groupls scattering and gathering along the crowded sides.

William pulls the glass wagon.

Spear strepos and stares a group of hugoblins and elsv from William's bath. He big hands clench a fist. He pulls back his hood. Spear's big human haead, like a block  of tension overed with a flaring head of hair.

A few orcs step away.

One orc points at William and grunts adn groans sounds.

Kirra walks behine the wagon and Wiliam.

William says loud, ,,I hear Myst's song lead to the Rise of our path.''

,,Food,'' says Kirra.

William grips the rods of the wagon and huffs. ,,Kirra, if you search for the food and purchase along the way then we may arrive in time. Spear.''

,,The wagons of armor move,'' say Spear with deep voice. His quiet steps and tone flows over William and calms the sting of the scar of Reighn.

,,Our time is near when we must be rolling with them.'' He glances at Kirra.

Kirra stands next to William. ,,Cube.''

William grabs the cube with his steel hand and gives it to Kirra. ,,You best be ready for the gold to use.''

Spear slows steps and looks at Kirra. ,,I go. I carry sacks. We meet Wiliam near Myst.''

,,Yes, my friends, Spear,'' say William. William stops pull and stands. He looks at Spear. ''It is a wise path. I will pull.''

Spear doens't look at William and Steps with Kirra.

Kirra walks from the path and quick walks along the crowds of people.

William pulls the cart along the road toward the song and Myst. He glances at Spear and Kirra through the people.

Spear and Kirra walk as one being ready to strike an who stand in path.

People part a parth from Spear and Kirra as Kirra and Spear walk side by side toward the crowd.

People step back from lines leading to tables of pots of steaming food.

Fumes of roast, potatoes, ale and fat float and pull the food.

Spear peers long the people and sees a sprint from stand a tent with sacks stackes around hanging sage and mint.

kirra smells the sage and mint and looks to Spear.

Spear nods. ,,Food.''

Kirra smiles. She slips from pockets adn two pouches and counts 20 fang gold.

A crowd cheers louder than all the talk and mumlbes and a few clicks.

Spear and Kirra walk toward the sacks.

Spear glances at William pull the cart across the open space of hte road.

The wood carts of the caravan pull behind Wlliam.

Myst and Guile stand at the edge of the crowd walking, jostling standing on the other side of the wide glass road.

Myst sees Willima through song.

Then Guile sees Willim through sight.

Guile sniffs. ,,William. Cart's empty.''

Myst says with hum. ,,The cart has two wheels and an axle.''

Giule peers. ,,Is that glass?''

,,Yes,'' says Myst. ''The sound...'' Myst stands. 

Guile steps, sniffs. ,,We meet William.''

,,Wiliam will join us,'' says Myst.

William pulls toward Myst and the song of the sound as the sound clears his mind and sooths the pull of cart. The song guides past people standing and a pack of gobblins chaings a dog along the road. 

William sees Myst and pulls. He pulls with force and painless with the song until he stands before Myst and Guile. He hums.

Myst reaches for her drum with a smile and their songs meet like cymbal and clashes.

,,Where will our song sing?'' says William. ''I have a wagon to haul the feed.''

Myst steps near Walliam. ,,And with our song I will see.'' 

Guile sneeze. ,,We go if please.''

Myst taps her drum swinging by her hip. 

William feels calm and releases the metal grip on glass. ,,Spear and Kirra are searching for food.'' He looks to his Wane at the other side of the road. ''We should meet the two and gather our food along the way.''

Guild sniffes. ,,Caravan guards close. Caravan rolls.''

Wiliam steps. ,,Then we cross the road and meet Kirra and Spear as the purchase the food for our jounry across the drought land.''

Myst grabs Willaim's shoulder. ,,We had a guard follow from the caravan to the other side of the road.'' She points toward a group of people circling around a black and red soldiers wrestling with a dwarf. ''There be caravan guards on the other side following guile after an amdire of Guile's armor made it know to all.''

William clenches jaw and peers at Guile then over to the ruckus. ,,We should join them with the cart and hope Reighn leaves their song rolling to us.''

,,They come this way,'' says Guile. They roll toward the exit.

William nods. Myst lowers her hand and they step together.

William says, ,,Guile, do you know how we are to travel or how the path works. Will we be allowed to leave? What do we need to do to hid with this caravan?''

Guile snorts. ,,Seen this in mind. Don't know way out. I see mind to change thoughts. They help us.''

William nods. Myst hums. They lead the trio across the road with William pull the cart towards Spear and kirra

Spear and Kirra walk the path spread by people. They steps to the pavillion hanging over stacks of bags. 

Under the pavillion. rows of burlap bags shades of brown stack as tall as spear. Eachs ack as big as a human torse. Pictures of potatoes, roots, cord and grass are paininted faded on the bag. The burlpa bags stack around the pavillion creating a wall and a maze that leads to the center and three gnomse.

The three gnomes dress in brown brulap bag shirts and pants and thick hide overalls. Sweat stains match the cloths while their thin white hair spreasd over sholders. One gnomse ponts at a corn bag and talks with an elf. One gnome looks in side a torn sack. One gnomse steps to Spear and Kirra. 

The gnome says with hand out. ,,My name is Cliino. What do you want?''

Spear steps close the Cliino and stares down. ,,Food.'

The gnome says with hand out. ,,My name is Cliino. What do you want?''

Spear steps close the Cliino and stares down. ,,Food.'

Clinno smiles and stares with Spear. ,,WE have no food for you.'' He looks at Kirra. ''We have not food fo you.'' He puts thumbs in waist pockets and lets arms hangs.

 ''We have food for pack animal. We serve ox, bulls, clocki, horses, desert bulls.'


The halfing talking with elf looks at Clinno.

Clinno steps a back from Spear and Kirra. ,,We have food for desert travel. And all this food can be ate. We...'' He sides steps to lean on a stack of big bags with a long rod root on the side. The roots shells bits stick to the sack. 

A gnome talking with elf and pointing to coin bag clicks and steps toward Spear and Kirra and Clinno.

Clinnos says, ,,This is Hinnlop.''

Hinnlop wearing brown burlap body suite with cotton overalls. He loops thumbs around overall strapss and pulls. ,,Hinnlop is the name,'' says the skinny hairy gnome with eyes and big lips with oval head making the feathers draw and wonder. 

Clinno steps to theelf.

Hinnlop says, ,,We have food for all animal. Over in the back we have the bags of human and goblins food. Even the gnomes and elves will eat i.'' Hinnlap waves arm. Come.

Hinnlop steps from Spear and Kirra while face Spear and waving plams toward him and along an isle.

Along the isle sacks with pictures of corn, strawy, lamb, rice and root are sewen into the bags.

Gnomse wearing burlaps and talking with ids and id looking hugoblins. 

A group of humans wearing white ropes and head wraps lift sacks from wood wagons and stack the sacks at the end of a long wide row of sacks.

The row leads to a path of people looking at sacks and unload wagons of sacks. A few wood wagons are packed with sacks and glass wears. Poeple whearing think silk and cotton talk to a few gnomes about buying glass and food.

Hinnlop leads with waving arms to stack of sack. Sne slaps a side. ,,Trail mix.'' She puts thumbs under the straps of overalls. She winks at both Spear and Kirra. ''How much of this good and hearty food perfect for a journy across even the greatest of adventure.'' She kicks the sack while starring at both Kirra and Spear. ''How must you needs.''

,,We go rise over the desert,'' says Spear.

Kirra steps from Spear. She nods at Spear along the row.

Spear nods. 

Kirra walks around.

Hinnlop nods and glances at Kirra the she looks at Spear. ,,Rise of the desert is a dangerous path. The journey to the rise is forty rises and forty sets. A bag a trail mix.'' She leans against sacks. She pulls tight on the overall straps . ''You size. You feed on sack...You feed about ten or twelve days. The bag has all you need for fight and the sun. The sun will cool. How many you have travelling with you?''

Kirra peers at Hinnlop. Then looks back, along the row, toward the entrance and the people walking past.

The people walking past bustle and shake. A few stop to look at food. 

Kirra looks where the row ends.

Carts load and unload ssacks of root, grain, flour. Carts stands empty along a narrow road.

Beyond the carts, backs and wogons of stored wares wait while their selles to the Wax and Wane sell.

Spear says, ,,Four.''

,,Four your sized for forty days. Four total. That's sixteen sacks of Trail Mix.'' Hinnlop follows Kirra's stare. ''You have a cart.''

,,Yes,'' says Spear. ''Cart pulled here.''

,,You'll need a cart. You're big. But forty days across the desert is too much for one.'' Hinnlo pulls arm from suspender and points to the back and an empty cart. ''That empty cart there can get you across the desert.''

,,We have a cart,'' says Spear. ''We need water.''

Hinnlo smile and chucle laughs. ,,You need water. You need money. I have no water.'' Hinnlo smiles. ''I do have a fellow business partner, not far from here, that can sell you enough water for forty days in glass containers. What kind of cart you have?''

,,Glass,'' says Spear.

,,Glass will not carry glass. Not enough bounce or give. Wood is more sturdy.'' She glances along a row to another halfing, winks and looks at Spear. ''Rittlop will hlep you with your purchase and will give you directions for water.'' She looks at Kirra nd Spear.

Kirra and Spear follower Hinnlo's glances back and forth. Hinnlos says, ,,YOu tell, Mino that Hinnlo sent you. She'll sell what is needed. You will need waterskin sacks. No glass jars. The waterskin sakes do cost more. Water skins are hard to break.''

Spear nods. Kirra glances. 
 
A gnome taller than the rest, but one head shorter than Kirra, steps to the group.

Hinnlo pulls finger from suspenders and points to the tall gnome. ,,Klintt will help complete the trade of eleven bags of this Trail Mix.'' Hinnlo place palm on chest, ''I need to help other customers find what they need to live and survive.'' Hinnlo makes a fist and steps from the row laong another row to the group of id and id looking hugoblins.

Klinnt smles and slights a bow. She slides finger over brow to pull a few white hairs behind ears. Her breasts push from a tight burlap fest helded to gether with silver button. As she stands from slight bow, a wiff of mint frost cools the nose and chills the body. Her big eyes and thick lips kiss the words as she says, ,,I, Klinnt, will help you pack your load.'' She smiles.

Spear shrugs shoulders and nods head back. He looks at Klinnt's breasts and tightly packed curved body with hips bouncing out.

Kirra look away and steps from Klinnt.

At the begininng of the row, where Kirra and Spear entered, people steps away. One barks.

Kirra steps from Klinnot and Spear.

Klinnot says, ,,You retireve you cart and pull it arond the back to hear. We talk about pricess and want.'' She licks lips and points I will be there.

Kirra sees William push self and cart between a group of hugoblins. She steps to William.

Spear watches Klinnot walk to a small glass tables. Four gnomes sit at table and on hugoblins looking id.

,,Spear,'' says Kirra.

Spear steps toward Kirra, but hold glare at Klinnot a few steps before seeing Kirra and William.


William stands at the entrance far along the row.

Myst and Guile step behind the wagon and follow William across the road.

Across the road, a few wagons roll and people walk here and there under the bright light from above. 

On the other side of the road, people wander and slow walk along the stacked sackes, stacked wood cups, wood bowls, hanging straws and gords. One the other side of the road, the fight between the dwarf and two soldiers is stopped as the dwarf lay still. Across the road, the two purple and yellow guards wander toward a train of wooden wagons stacked with armor. The guards swords hang from fists. 

William pulls the cart across the wide road and hums with Rieghn.

Rieghn hums with throat and whistle a hum with lips. Her hum sounds like strings the pull the across.

The strings of the song sing through Guile. 

Guile feels the soothing song organize the maze in mind and calm the pain of thoguht.

Guile scrambles the sernity of the music to create a maze to pain. Guile paces his mouth breathing to create a path through the music.

Myst taps her drum to let the boom spread to silence through the disonance of murmurs, talks, shouts, laughter ro yelling. 

William pulls the carts acrsoos the road to the pavillion with stacks of sack where spear was last seen.

Guile sees through the pain and hums the song. 

Myst sees through the packs and follows William.

Wiliam pushes cart to the sacks and lets the cart poles drop. Sweat drips from William's nose.

Kirra says loud, ,,WILLIAM.''

William sees Kirra and Spear.  William raises his steel hand. 

Kirra steps fast along rows of sacks. ,,We go behind.''

William squints, ,,Behind?''

Kirra stesp before William and points along the road to a wide path from the road. She points behind toward Spear. ,,Move behind.'' Kirra steps, grabs the poles and pulls through the people.

People step back. They mummble. A few click and clack. 

Kirra pulls the cart to a small road row. 

The row is lined with people standing and kneeling to look at wood bowls and leather belts; fur blankets and straw hats and baskets. 

Kirra pulls the cart to a small path the width of wide wagon. She pulls the cart along the path and stops behind a wood wagon. 

People walk around.

People walk around.

William says, ,,Where are going?''

,,We buy,'' says Kirra. ''Here'' 

Spear walks from the sacks and steps to Klinnot.

Klinnot talks with an id looking hugoblins. The talk mummbles of common and quiet as Separ steps to her and the glass table.

Spear points, ,,The cart is ready.''

Klinnot smils and prousts breasts to bloom. ,,Yes, I see you cart.'' She smiles. I will need the payment, and we will load your cart.''

Spear nods. He steps from table, shoulder nudges and id. 

The id and id hugoblins step at Spear. 

Spear flexes and steps toward Kirra and the cart. ,,Cube,'' he says. 

,,I believe Kirra should have the cube for payment,'' says William. He looks at Spear.

Spear looks away and at Kirra.

Kirra tosses the cube to Spear.

Spear catches.

William steps to Spear. ,,I shall assist in the purchase.''

Spear tenses amrs and steps toward Klinnot.

Klinnot stops talk with a smile and looks from the id hugoblins to Spear. She opens and palm and smiles. She inhales. Her breast boom. She exhales. And mint spreads.

Spear feels cool spread through body. He sniffs and smells the sweat. His heat beats and body tenses. He drops the cube to hand.

Klinnot closes hand and gribs cube. ,,I hope its big enough.'' She grins and walks to the table.

In the center of table, a glass tube with a light blue radiates from base to tip. The tube stands end on end.

Klinnot places the glass cube on the top of tube... She walks with grin at Spear.

Spear stands and sniffes her sweat. Sweat smell pounds the beat of Spear's heard. He breathes deeps and stands.

Klinnet steps before spear, pinches the cube and raises the cube to Spear's sight. Her head hovers near Spear's stomach. ,,The cube is broke.'' She smiles, but not as wide and long and with he stare at the cube held before Spear.

Spear sniff the mint and sweat and grabs cube. He sniffs and peers down, steps from Klinnet.

Klinnet steps and walks to table. She smiles at a hugoblins looking hugoblin sitting at big glass seat at table.

Spear walks to Kirra, the cart and the rest of the pack. He stares at Kirrra and tosses the cube. ,,Dead.''

Kirra catch and clenches the cube. She slips five fange coins from belt pouch.

William says, ,,I may be of help in getting what we need for less money than we have.'' He smiles dimples. His hair frames stotic faces caste like fine etched stone. ''It would be a help to get more for less.''

Kirra peers at William, says, ,,You would love that.'' She steps from William past Spear and at Klinnet.

Spear and William glance at other then Spear say at Myst, ,,Watch the caravan.'' He steps past Myt and along thepeople

Spear sees the peoole.

Hugoblins spread thick between the people leaving their sweet sweat stench that lingers like Love in his mind. He sees people glance at him and feels their fear. Spear walks with eyes forward and looking everywhere even a bit behind to see and feel.

He feels the rage and the love and walks through teh people to the edge of the street.

A four square of red black soldiers stand with backs in the road looking at people. People spread around.

The caravan of wagon and armor rolls single file along the roll.

Ghhrend leads of foot guiding with eight purple/yellow guards with short swords and small shieds.

Spear sees everywhere with focus forward. He feels William a sprint away. He castes the rage.

The rage if felt by William by the song of Reighn faint in his mind. The song sings low hums and deep pounds.

William watch Kirra with his hand on hilt. He hums wiht Myst who taps drum. 

The drum taps slow to Guile sound maze and pain sphere.  
 
Guile sniffes and look at the people and the food. He feele a tickle of dust. He sneezes and feels pain prick neck. He presses on ankle and focuses on the pain and Kirra.

Kirra steps with four Gold Fang Coins and steps to Klinnot. 

Klinnot talks to the id hugoblin. 

Kirra says, ,,Money. Give us food.''

Klinnot looks at Kirra and then the id and says, ,,You will be able to pull your wagon around the back. Is there anything else I can help you with-''

Kirra steps. Her chest touches Klonnot's back and breath breath down on Klinnot's head. ,,Our food.''

The id hugoblins click hard.

Kirra nd the id hugoboins stare.

Kirra flexes wrist and snaps and lets dagger slide into palm. She hides the blade and handle.

The id hugolbins looks away.

Klinnot spins with a smile and whiff if sweat sent of mint. ,,A new cube.'' She glances at the id hugoblins adn blinks to Kirra. ''Will it be big enough?''

Kirra says, ,,Three gold for all the food.''

Klinnot's eys open wide and stern faces softens. ,,Gold.'' She glances a the id hugoblin. She glares at Kirra. ,,We do not take gold.'' She winks and nods head to war the far corner of the back of pavillion. ''We will try you cube again. If you pull you wagon near the feed mix bags we will load them on the wagon.''

Kirra peers at Klinot and looks at the carts.

Klinnot smiles and nods to the far back conrer and follows nod with a twirl to look up at the hugobins id. The mint swirls.

Kirra walks from the Mint and to Spear.

William and Myst whil both hum slow and calm using an echo of distant drum to set the pace.

Guile creates a maze through the whistle with his pain and away from the purr.

Willliam hums to say, ,,Are they not taking our gold away from the their food?''

Kirra glances at William and looks at Myst, ,,No gold there.'' Kirra grabs the cart poles and pulls. ''We go there. They take gold there.''

William steps with cart. ,,Well that is odd behavior. Could it be that their intentions are to take the gold from us.''

,,Move,'' says Kirra. ''And ready to stab if they try take.'' She pulls the carts to the back of one cart being loaded with bag. She pulls the cart between a tight space between dwarves wrapped from head to toe with white robes wrapped around body. Thick tube impressions twist around legs and arms and chest and neck. Goggles that look like Hern's Glasses hanging on string. A thin space around eyes stare at Kirra as she pulls past. 

Anolther wagon follows another. 

Gnomes step from Kirra's bath and they click and clack and hugoblins wearing burlap pants and shirts.

The hugoblins in burlap shirts and pants stand in fours and click and clack in pace as they lift, stack and move bags from stacks to wagons and wagons to stacks of bags. 

The wagons being unloaded are surrounded by beings wrapped in sheets with cord like shapes wrapped around legs and arms and neck. Glasses hang around neck. Sand grain fall from sheets to the sand covered ground.

The wagons loaded are pulled and guided by goblinkin and a few humans wearing pants, vets, shirts and embroded cloths.

William puts hand on hilt, hears the song of Reighn strike a cord and lets hand fall.

Kirra pulls the wagon to an open spot, before the line of carts being load near the bags of trail mix.

Klinnot step to kirra with hands clasped below waits and mout smiling. ,,Four of your gold for the sacks for food.''

,,Three,'' says Kirra.

Klinnot's smile falls and hands unclasp and land on hips. ,,We sell for three. You load. You leave.'' She extends palm.

Kirra slips three gold from her hand to Klinnot's palm.

Klinnot grabs the gold and slips them in pocket. She looks over shoulder and follows look to turn from Kirra.

Kirra says, ,,William, Spear load.'' She watches Klinnot.

Klinnot slides edge of gold into mouth and bits. She smiles and looks at the orcs and other gnomses adn waslks between stacks of bags from Kirra's view.

Kirra and William load the fourty-four sacks of trail mix into the cart. Each grab a sack and toss inside cart making their piles that meet int he middle.

William says, ,,We may need rope to hold the quipement from fallout the back.''

Kirra shrugs shoulders and nods head back. 

Kirra grabs the cart poles and pulls along the path into a row.

Wood boxes, shelves and wood boards stack and lean along the sides of the path of the row. People stare and look. The lift boards and look along their planes.

Guars wearing faded black and red studded leather and hild their tarnished small shiedls and swords toward the person they peer at.

Kirra pulls cart by two guards to her Wax then she pulls to the Wane into the wide open road.

Spear peers and feels for the cold and dark of the shadow soldiers. 

LIght shines bright from above. From above warmth spreads. Light shines over the people spanning Wax to Wane of his stance.

To his Wax, Spear sees Kirra and pulls focus from the caravan to Kirra. 

The caravan rolls slow down the middle of the roads two stone throws away from Spear. Guards of purple and yellow spread before the caravan starring and nudging people from the caravan path. A few goblins ox shits and one pisses. A hafling wearing pants and shirt kicks sand on the shit and piss and sweep it into to packe. The caravan squeaks its wooden wheels roll.

The carvan rolls a stones throw from Spear as Kirra pull close to Spear. 

Spear feels a few stares and a few pumbps as the people look at the bags of food. Spear steps with Kirra and walks infront of Kirra as Kirra pulls the cart.

William quick steps from Myst to Separ and Kirra. William says and points with steel hand. ,,Water. We need water.''

,,Mino has water,'' says Spear loud and not glancing back and Kirra and William. ''Water is around.''

,,The caravan is near and we have yet water.'' William steps along side Kirra and looks from Kirra to the back of Spear. 

,,GET WATER,'' says Spear. 

A few people glance back at Spear and quick step from his path.

William glenches jaw and squeezes steel fists. His heart thumps. The heart thumps pound like a drum thorugh is guitar string song of Reighn singing in mind. The drum pounds and hits. William's jaw and fist relaxes. Fist becomes an hanging hand. William says, ,,I will be off for water, but I have nothing to give, but this breast plate and plates of armor, but for the desert these are not protection.'' He follows the beat of drum with step.

Kirra raises a fist. She drops sixteen fang coins. ,,Money.'' Sweat drips from her forhead. She grabs the other pole and pulls the wagon.

William grabs the gold and hears the beat of the song of Reighn, and steps from the road and to the sides. He jogs around, between and through people with the beat of the drum pace of his song. He mumbles. ,,Water and rope and goods for the desert are in need. We have the feed. The feed. The water...The water...'' He jogs by spice packs, salt stands, steel wheels.

People peer and glance at William as he pases. People shout at people on point. People shout, ,,SWORDS, SHORT,'' and point. The shout numbers and cost. They shout point fingers at ,,BIG BOWL BROWN...,'' and ,,SOLD FOR ONE...'' and ,,HARD ONE,'' and ,,HIGH! HIGH!'' and ,,LOW! LOW!'' Snorts and coughs spray with sprays of snot.

Guile follows William as William steps from cart. Guile sniffs and clears throat and spits on ground. ,,Should we follow?''

Myst humms, ,,WE will follow with a song to help William find the path to complete the song.''

Guile nods and walks with the cart. He peers between the people and the shadows.

The shadows flow and move below the people. 

Guile walks with Myst, and Myst follows the cart leading her hum and thump on her drum.

Her drum thumps pounds.

Drum thumps beat in William minds. His walk and set to the beat through the people pointing, looking and taking at glass scultures, root skin baskets, spears and knives. 

Shouts leads William with the pounding of Myst through Reighn. He walks with the sounds and hears. ,,WATER, WATER!''

William follows water shouts to a group before a pavilloions with glass walls and a double door. In the double door, is a desk where two gnomes stand and shout. points and wave. From the doubles doors spans thepeople and walls. 

The people stands  and funnel between two steel pools tied with rop that leads a few steps to the steel tables and two gnomes.

Tens soldiers wearing pink and blue leather and chain mails stand with small shields and words along the wall and rope line to the table.

Behind the table, two gnomes stand. One gnome takes glass cubes and sets them on a glowing cylindar. If the cylinder becomes blue then another gnome steps back, grabs one or two sacks or a few glass cubes the size of a head an sets them on the metal table. If the cyclinder glows red then the cube is given back to the buyer, and a guard grabs the person adn shoves them along the wall back into the people.

An elf and a hugoblins point at a glass cube on the elf palm and shout at the guard.

The guard stands and stares and holds its sowrds.

William steps. He taps foot with Myst' drum beats and hums the song as he steps along the line.

Myst taps and walks with the slow pull of Kirra. She watches the equally slow roll of the caravan they follow.

Guile sniffs and says. ,,I go help. Get in minds. Push this song.'' He scratec cheek. ''Will only have gold. Thos soldiers look business.

Myst hums and nods. 

Kirra blows sweat drop from nose and looks back. She nods and shrugs shouldrs and pulls.


Spear walks and feels Guile walk away, but focuses forward and to side. He feels the flow of people find itself and show itsefl. Spear feels no shadow soldirs nor the coming of the train. He glances at William.

William steps to the steel table and the gnome. ,,My name is William Westmore. I am in need of the water.''

The gnome says, ,,You give glass cube.'' He lifts hand and clicks fingers. He looks back. He looks at William.

,,I have gold,'' says William. 

The gnome peers at William. He looks behind. ,,We charge one credit for every ten translated.'' He poins along the cloth wall drapped to the far end. 

William opens palm. Five gold Fang coinds shine with the light.

The gnome grabs one and peers. She nods. ,,Along the wall. We translate gifts into items.''

Willima glances back.

The lind twists and bends around and along the wall. He looks at the gnome and hums. He stares and smiles with dimples. ,,I am in need of help now else I will be left behind from the caravan.''

An orc grunts behind.

William talks on with a song like tone to voice. ,,It would give my song a soft note of love to hope it will survive the walk.''

The gnome blinks. She looks behind William. She smiles and nods. 

One yells. ,,WATER. MOVE. WATER MOVE.'' A gnome behind the gnome talking with William peers at William.

The gnome before William says with grin. ,,You place order here. You pay at the hub.''

William shrugs and nods head back. He smile from a grin and says showing all teeth. ,,Thank you.'' He lets the you trail and eyes peer. 

The gnome says, ,,What water you want?''

,,I need enough water for...'' William clenches fist, feels the rush of rage, hears a few guitar plucks play into calm strings. He says, ,,I travel to East across the desert and i need water for five people.

An orc steps by will as another gnome steps to the table. 

The gnome before William open eyes wide and stares. ,,You want glass or hide containers?''

William smiles. ,,I am sorry, but I was teleported here, so I am ignorant of many things. Glass or hide is one of them? What are these choices?''

The gnome sighs and nods heads. Whit a slight grin, she says, ,,Water will not evaporate from glass. Glass breaks easier than hide.''

,,Evaporate,'' says William. ''What is evaporate?''

The gnome shakes head slight. ''Water heats. Water becomes gas and floats away.''

,,I wish to buy half glass and half hide if I can. I would like enough water for five across the desert,'' Willia grabs the sack of fang coins. ''I have enough gold to spend.''

The gnome nods an points to the Wane of William. ,,You give gold for credit cub. You give credit cube to worker along Wane wall.''

,,And what wane do you speak over,'' says William.

The gnome raises other arm and poinst to William's Wax.

William stairs.

The gnome nods and steps from the table.

Another gnome wearing white shirt and blue overalls steps to the table. ,,Your order is being processed. Please move along.''

William steps once then twice and walks to the a three person deep line before a tiny window in the cloth wall.

On the other side of the window, a gnome with thick white eyebrows and two tufts of ear hair smiles. A light shines from below illuminating the face in a darkenss that surrounds beyond the window.

Three hugoblins with human features stand singlef lie from Window. Each dress in a white body suit that appears to wrap around tubes. The tubes twit around legs and arms. Hoods hang from back of body suits. masks hang around neck of the three hugoblins.

One hugoblins talks and points at palm and fist.

William stands and looks back at the wagon and the caravan.

The carts stands by Kirra, who stands with the pack looking at the people and watching the backs. 

The caravan stretches now twelve wagons long and rolls behind wagons filling with glass. The wagons filled with glass roll from a crowded road on the other side of the street from the wagon and where William waits for water.

People jostle wax to wan along the road. Along the road a far stones throw toward the Rise where the caravan rolls is an intersection of raod.

The intersection of road meets witha mass of people, carts, wagons and beats blustering.

The drums and strings echoing around, around, around sing with the blusters and moos of beast pusing lowing thorugh people walking.

,,Moves,'' says Guile as he looks at the caravan slow roll it's path to them. He sniffs. ''No water.'' He look from Kirra to Myst. ''Pulls wagon near William.'' He sniffs.

Myst hums and nods. ,,We will aid William with calm and we will meet the caravan where it goes.''

,,Where it goes?'' says Spear.

Kirra looks at Guile.

Guile shrugs. ,,If not desert. Don't know. Love didn't.'' He looks at Kirra and Spear.

Kirra grabs the poles. ,,Water.'' He pulls on the cart and palls into the mass of people along the edge of road. Her hand with missing pinky throbs as she grips the pole. Her ribs feel dull ache as she breathes a deep clear breeth. ''Our path is slow and dangeroue.''

,,We need the cravan.'' Spear looks over the heads of most the people execpt a few ids walking with id looking goblins.

Goblinkin step from the path of Spear.

Spear's brick heard and muscle body sweats and stares. He peers down the people and a path toward William.

William stands and glances back.

Spear looks past William and around. He steps and jostle with people. 

People spreads from behind  Spear and before Kirra.

Kirra pulls behind, and Myst walks behind the wagon humming and radiating a calm sound that sooths over the faces and hands of those steping Wax and Wan past the wagon.

Myst walks an arm reach from the wagon and hums.

A small hugoblins like a thin Shake steps by Myst with head nodding. She hums with Myst.

A few hums with Myst and people slow their step. One orc pumped by Spear qquiets grunts and hums with Myst.

The song of Reighn spans with a few hums and whistls.

The people jostling Wax and Wane slow and step out other's way. People hear the whistle, hum and tap and step from the path other others.

One shouts, ,,TUNE BLOWS DEATH!' while others hum and step from Myst's path.

Myst throat sing to spread a deep and wide vibration to see Guile, the caravan and the animals

Guile steps away from Myst and jostling people toward the caravan.

The caravan and animals roll toward intersection of wide roads an arua of red around the bull and they bluster and blow; stomp and clomp hovers; they piss and shit. The bull shit and piss plot and spread over the ground and smears with hooves and boots as the caravan wagons roll long.

Guards walk in fours along the sides and behind the caravan. Each guard whereds the purple studded leather comverd with a long purples chain shirts that hands to the waist. Around the waist a yellow short sword scabbard hangs. All soldiers hold their shining short swords with their Wane hand and hold their shields with their wax hand as they march in fours along the wagon.

Inside the ring of soldiers, workers wearing overalls and thick hide pants and coats hold ropes, pull on yokes and shake a side of wagon; pull in net peer at the people looking at the wagons and stacks of armor. Workers wear belts with ppuchs, hammars, saws, bars and shovels haning from waists. Belts cross chests to hold more pouches and shining keys and sheathed nives, screw drives, plyers. 

Ghhrend walks at the front of the cravan on top a large bull pulling the lead wagon. A sixteen warriors who are mostly goblinkin walk around Ghhrend with ten workers who are mostly dwarf.

People step from the path of the caravan or are pushed by soldirs' shields and hit with hilts of swords.

The caravan rolls slow along the road.

Guile walk toward the caravan. He glances at the shadows flowing and bouncing with the people. He releases the sphere of pain trapping thorugh with maze. 

A purr spread thorugh Guile's mind and body soothing. 

Guile focuses through the purr and sees, >Where to see, Love.< 

Voices feel the silence after thoughts site to all. The voice whisper talk, click and clack in to one mass of noise.

The purr feeling fades, and hundreds of voices dim as laughter rises and chuckles. 

Guile feel the laughter adn for a moment feels lost and step, but step step and steps near the guards of the caravan. The laughter spreads through the purrs and Love sees, >You make your way. Or you will remain. You are one of many. You need to prove your worth.<  The laughter fluxes and shifts like a tornatod of words swirling around Guile's mind.

Guile sees through the ache in leg. Ache spreads through mind, the laughter and the purr. Ache pain is focused, and Guile shouts a thought using the pain to spreads to all around.

A few hugoblins in white cotton robes flows by Guile and through the mental shout.

The mental shout spreads through a group of sand govern warriors; a groups of beings whearing white body suits wrapped tight around body and tubes with cloths over face and googles over eyes as sand falls to the ground.

An echo of shouts and mumbles reflect from the minds that surround. Feelings of stress and tension spread thorugh guile and thump Guile's brain. 

Guile sees through the minds and hears the thoughts of. <Sword and shield. Have to go? Can stay. Don't want the suit...This is slow. Run. Got the power. Take it to them. Them. Them. That there...< The internal dialog mumbles to a feeling a tension and stress.

Guile flows mind with the tension and stress and follows the stress to the sight as Guile walks a slow path toward the caravan.

then Guile's sight becomes a gray sight becomea point like looking through the opposite end of telescope. Guile sees the thoughts of, <Do I have to go? They said I have to go. They said I have to go. They said. Gij Klo...Did some one call my name. I heard Gij Klo, but...> The sight of Gij Klo sees over guards walking with wagons. The sight looks back and around and even glances at Guile's body as Guile's body walks slow overthe ground. 
 
Guile's body stops to a stands. A few warriors step around Guile. One spits on Guile and walks away. The others laugh.  
Guile feels the rage of getting spit on and sends it through the thoguht stream to Gij Klo. 
 
Gij Klo walks with the caravan guards near the middle of the wagon train. He walks in near sync with  and full of soldirs. He thinks and Guile sees the thoughts, <Don't want to go. Not. Glji died. Died heat all the heat and the luck and the pay. Not much. Money. But this. Didn't want. No much pay. No...>

And Guile sees through the thoughts stream to Gij Klo leaving faint voice of, >Gij Klo...Gij Klo...Gij Klo

Gilo twitch arm and steps from the four square of soilers. ,,Who says my name?''

Guile sees to Gli Klo's mind, >Gli Klo, I am behind you.<

Gli Klo turns around.

The four guard square, now three, stops and look at Gli Ko.

>We are watching you,< sees Guile to Gli Klo.

Gli Ko says, ,,WHO'S IN MY MIND!''

A four square of guards marches from the fron of wagon train toward Gli Ko.

Guile is nudges. Guile stumbles back and opens eyes while sending the thoughts to Gli Ko, >Gli Ko, don't want to go. Gli Ko tell everyone. Gliko tells all of desert fear. Desert fear...Sand and now water.<

As Guile sees through minds and moves the hugoblins body of Gij Klo, Spear jostles and stares a path through the people to William standing in line to exchange the gold of credit.

Spear says, ,,Where's water?'' He stares at William.

William feels the tone and deep thump of Spear's voice. He sees many look at Spear and step back from Spear. He says and look at Spear. ,,We need to use credit to purchase the water there for we need to use this station to exchange gold from credit?''

Kirra sets cart on the side of the line to the credit winow and gnome.

The gnome through the window peers at Kirra then Spear as he grasps silver and gold coins on palm.

Spear looks away from William's look and looks over the crowd at the shadows, people and guards, ,,Get water.''

Myst hums to a stopping stands and whistles a blow while tapping on drum.

The whistle blows and taps pace a finger on a hafling standing before William. 

Wiliiam changes his near quiet hum to one fast and excited like a whistle of a bird.

The halfing standing before William look back at William. ,,I hear you need to move woule you like to step aheard.''

Wiliam smiles and stares at the halfing with long ponytails and skinny bone face. ,,My the song of Reighn sing for you?'' He glances at the pack back and smiles. ''We have the song of Reighn singing for use as we are in a hrry for the desert.'' He looks athte halfling. ,,I am William Westmore.''
,,KLOOOON MILLO. A gnome name. But I am not known to my father. Here from a fare.'' He raise hands up. ''Going above to the great desert to go to the rise.'' He opens palm and poinst to it. ''I forgot to get water and need a new filter and glasses for the walk. Have you seen a good place to buy glasses?''

Wililam glances at the window and at the gnome. ,,I do know know what you speak off.''

,,Glasses,'' says the halfling as he lifts a pair of glasses like googles hanging around neck. ''They protect your eyes from the sun. This suites collects my sweat for water. It cools through cloths meshs.'' KLOOOON MILLO pulls on the hip of body suit. ''The desert gets cold at night.''

,,Cold during the night and like the fires of the pits of evil during the day.'' William looks at the haflin from tip to top. 

The hafling is covered with patches of sand by pits and crotchs. The white body suit with tubes running through sprinkles sand.

,,YOu step to the window,'' says the tuft eared gnome.

KLOOOON MILLO steps behind William. ,,You go first, so I may here this lovely whistle and hum from the Tune priest.''

,,Reighn,'' says Wllliam as he stands to the window. He slaps steel palm  and gold on surface on bottom of window. ''I would like some credit to purchase you watern. I was told-''

,,YOu give me cube and pay ten to one,'' says the gnome with a peer then slow look at the pack.

William clench hum and jaw.

Kirra pulls a cube from pouch and slaps it on table. Sweat drips from her nose. Seh blows, and sweat falls by her hand.

The gnaome takes the cube and cold.

Spear watches the people glances and stare. One points at William and whispers. ,,William Westmore,'' and one near the speaker says, ''And Kirra the Killer. I would...''

Spear looks and staresa t the two hugoblins talking and pointing at Kirra.

The two hugoblins looka way, but the dark goggles around neck to face and walk away with waterskins swishing over back.

Spear and Kirra hears a shout of, ''I WON'T GO INTO DESERT!'' over the hoots, hollers and drums solos srounding through the vaste ares.

Spear sees Guile stepping slow toward the caravan and sees some warriors talking. He looks at a couple of orces that feel to be of anger. He glances at Kirra. ,,Keep cube.'' He says compling the stares at William then steps around with back to William.

William hums and look through the window and the darkenss for the gnome that took the cube and money.

William's hum sings with Myst.

Myst seeing a high throat tone the slows and lowers to a calm thought. A few people whistling with her whistler or tapping with her tap stops and walk away and the low throat hum spreasd around the ground the window.

William taps foot. ,,The humm pace feels...''

KLOOOON MILLO squints and nearly frounds, ,,It's a sad sound.'' He looks at Myst. ''Are you sad?''

Myst hums with throat and taps drum while says, ,,It sooths pain.''

The gnome of window appears from the dark and puts Kirra's cube on tray. ,,You have your money.''

William reaches for the cube. 

Kirra grabs cube.

Willam glares at Kirra and ooks at Spear.

William clench hum and jaw. He inhales and exhales and says while looking at the gnome. ,,Where do we get water?''

The gnome in the window points to William's wax and stares at the halfing behind william.

William steps and looks at KLOOOON MILLO. ,,I thank you, KLOOOON MILLO, for allowing use to continues.''

KLOOOON MILLO smiles and winkes, ,,And good luck on your travels over the desert as luck is needed even for the prepared.''

Williams says, ,,I will sing a song of Reighn that I hope you heard as the desert winds blow.''

KLOOOON MILLO glances back to Myst then looks at William. ,,If the song sings as this one of Tune then I hope to hear.''

,,Yes,'' William looks at Myst. ''Listening to such-''

,,YOU MOVE,'' shouts the gnome thorugh window.

William glances a sneer at the gnome and smileas at KLOOOON MILLO and steps. ,,I hope pleasent journies.'' He steps and grips the cube with naked hand.

Kirra grabs the cart poles and pushes the cart from the crowd and pulls the cart through the spead people standing along the edge of Road.

Myst hums and spread the vibrating song rising and lowering.

The song spreads a path before Spear with cross looks and long glares caste. One puts fingers in ears and shouts, ,,Quiet.''

Spear steps the pather and leads the cart glancing out the hugobins holding finger tips in hears.

The pack follows Spear through the groud to a line to water. He looks at Guile and sees four purple/yellow guards shouting close to Guile.

Guile stands on the other side of the big road. He sees the wagon train slow roll along the road. He watches the hugoblins guard, Gli Ko, stand and shout. ''I WON'T GOT TO THE DESERT.''

Gij Klo shouts. ,,WHO CALL MY NAME!'' He steps from the line of Warriors and raises swords and shield.

Gulie sees to Gli Ko, >You go to desert. Dry itching spreads...<

ij Klo rubs hilt of short swords against hip, shouts. ''I AM NOT GOING TO THE DESERT!''

He steps from the line of Warriors and raises swords and dagger.

The three guards near Gij Klo step around.

A four square from the front marches at Gij Klo. A warrior wiht the four square, a hugoboins with a missing heard, shouts, ''You at ease! YOU AT EASE!'' The missing ear hugoblins raises shield and swords and stands a breath away from Gij Klo. The other three fo the four square spread to circle around Gij Klo with the other three.

Gij Klo pushes shield agains the close hugoblins and spins with swing of sword. ,,BACK!''

The six around raises sheild and step back.

A few four square of soldiers marching with the wagons stand and watch. A few animal handlers join. 

People stop the walk along street and stare. They step and stand near the wagons. They point and talk. the people press and jostle to see. 

A few people standing by the pack look and walk to ward the sight.

The wagons stop, and the ox blusters. handlers pull on harness, shout and crack whips.

People gather around Guile.

Guile sees the scene, but streams from mind to Gij Klo. >Gij Klo. Back. Gij Klo down. GIJ KLO!<

Gij Klo swing swords, ,,NO.'' Gij Klo swing up.

The soldier in the circle near Gij Klo ducks sword swing and pulls sword from sheath. 

Gij Klo steps and runs at the circle of guards around him. he hist smalls shiedls. The soldiers push him back with their small shields.

,,YOU LET ME,'' shouts Gij Klo as a sword scrapes his leg.

Guile feels the cut in Gij klo's leg like an itch over his leg. Guile blinks and feels a throb in ankle. He stumbles when pushed by a people pressing to see. 

Guile walks away and weaves and pushes into the people toward the other side of the road.

Gij Klo shouts, ,,YOU  DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DI'' Then Gij Klo's voice silences. 

Guile pries between two people, feels a shock strike body. His body locks from step back. He stares and sees the fight and stands froze.

Spear watches the fight as the path to thewater line is cleared with Myst's throat song of Reighn.

Kirra sweats and pulls the cart to a glass gate.

Before the gate, stands guards. Beyond the gate spans a line.

The guards wear dull shinned breast plates and studded leather pants of black. daggers hang from belts. Their eyes peer under the brow of a steel helms with pair of eyes peering on the steel rim. Wrinkles and cuts spread over the warriors faces as they peer at the pack, the crowd and the water line standing behind a glass gate.

The water lines spanes from beyond a glass fense and into the covere of the caravan. Hugoblins farmers, one human wearing desert body suit, wagons and few beasts stands front to back glances and looking at the gnome guarrds standing around the glass fence and inside the pavillon. The line spans between fence into the paviliou then through a black sheet. The black sheet lays over the back of an empty glass wagon.

A few gnomes beyond the fense stand on platforms and stare over the crowd along the shaft and thorugh the sights of bows. 

One of the crossbow bolts aim at William and Kirra.

William looks over the people at the Caravan. ,,The caravn we follow has stopped. It appears there is fighting'' He peers and lifts to toe tips to see over some id looking hugoblins. ''Why is Guile standing close to the fight?''

A gnome guard says loud as she nudges William. ,,You and one enter.''

,,I,'' says Kirra. She looks at Spear. ''Guile.'' She nods head into the road.

Spear nods, like a gladiator. He stares down at Myst. ,,We go get.''

,,I will continue our song, Myst,'' says William. He wipes sweat from foreheard and rubs sweat from neck.

The gate swings open.

,,We go to Guile,'' Spear. He glances at William and looks at Kirra. 

Kirra and Spear looks. They stares.

Spear walks with Myst toward Guile.

William pulls cart, and Kirra steps with William between the fence and behind three hugobins wearing studded leather standing around a small cart.

William stops behind the hugoblins and small cart.

The gate is close by another guard. One guard pushes away a hafling dressed in green and read and shouts, ,,OFF THIEF,''

Kirra glances at Spear.

Spear walks across the wide road with Myst.

Kirra stands next to William, says, ,,Remember death?''

Wiliam stands stoic and striaght and stares at the backs of the people before in line. He feels the hum of Myst sing through his body and feel to sooth. 

Kirra stands next William and looks forward.

William says, ,,I have memories. I smell the smell of our nest. I feel cut and scare of Reighn on back. I taste the water rot the give us to drink.'' His voice trails, and the song of rieghn strings to a few plucks then silence. 

The workers and cart before jerk forward and stop.

Kirra looks at William.

,,I remember Love. And with Love, I remember nothing, but the pain of battle between. It's like a low drum beat vibrating low enough for me to follow a beat, but loud enough and contant enough to annoy.'' William stands.

The gate behind opens.

Kirra glances back.

,,If a pack,'' says Kirra. ''There is no Love beyond.''

William glacne behind, Kirra then forward. ,,If I am the only one who's mind was lost and body brought pain then let my mind be weak.'' He looks at Kirra. ''That time need not be a time I hope to relive or remember.''

,,I remember,'' says Kirra. ''Pain. Hunger.'' She stands and peers. ''Fear and love's purr. Stay with the pack.''

William shrugs and nods head back. ,,The pack.'' He soft chuckles and looks to the ground. The chuckles discords the guirtar melody pucking like wind's fingers through minds. ''All the lies and hopes for path to be anything but alive is my worry.'' He kicks foot at the sand spread over ground. ''Myst and the song of Reighn helps the purr and the pain of the past.'' He looks at Kirra. ''I listen and follow the path we have seen without though of the past because those thoughs cause pain and even pleasure I wish not remember.'' He raises shoulders and stands straight, looks forward. ''There is no past I want my song to remember of the time, but the ring of battle and the rise.''

,,The throat,'' says Kirra. ''When the song stops. We purr be. Will you kill self?''

William swallows. ,,A song sung with out my mind or body. It was loves song.'' He clences fist.

The people before step and pull wagon into and through the black current.

The gnomes standing around the glass fens and the platform peer at William and Kirra then look over the crawd.

Kirra steps back and glances around the gnome guards and the people standing behind.

The gate closes. 

Two humans wearing furless hides bundled over their bodies like mounts stand and fume sweat and piss. Their dirty faces stare mindless upon Kirra and William.

Kirra says, ,,Guile?'' He looks at William. ''Trust.

William looks at Kirra and glances behind. ,,I trust Guile to work to free himself from this place, but once in a land controlled by goblins where water can be found and food had with those of power that Guile will run with those who can provide.''

Kirra looka at William then forward. 

Wililam says, ''That thought being sung, I wonder if his plan is controlled be another then why were we not given a wgy for wasy pass with ease. A good plan? Or another tool of Love to play?''

William glances at Kirra.

Kirra nods. 

A gnome with cross bow says, ,,You step forward and follow the line.''

The gate opens.

Kirra and William pulls the cart into the black sheet...

While Kirra and William talked, Spear and Myst walk seeing the path of many people with their sight.

People spread then press to a crowd near a clutter of purple/yellow guardds near Guile as Guile stands.

Guile feels a shock jolt body. Guile pees, and piss spread through branching armor and leakes to grownd.

Guile's mind feels to float without a body. 

Around Guile, people step and press. One shouts and points. ,,Got a pisser!'' A few glance at Giule and the shouter, a short human with thin beard. 

People steps to look at the fight between two yellow and purple armored guards.

Four yelllow and purple guards try to tackle one purple and yellow guards. Two guards hold the one yellow and purple guard's legs while another holds it's shoulders and arms.

Fifteen yellow and purple guards form a ring around the four struggling guards.

People walk and press agains the ring of guards. 

The wagons with Ghrend's armor stops. 

Guards pull swords and peer along the crowd. 

A few ox blust. One moos and lets atou a graon.

People watch. The steps by Guile.

Guile feels a vibration like metal flow from body then leave body number. He feels to float. Murmurs and laughter spread through mind and around.

Laugh spreads through Guile's mind and his fingers and toes begin to twitch.

Guile focuses on the pee flow down leg and over ground. He feels the warm fluid stream. The feel of warmth and fluid spread from leg through body. Through body, a warm fluid feel flow through. The warm spread through the numb like water through a sponge. 

Guile's fingers and toes calm twitching. Guile stands and breathes and feels a hand slap on his shoulder.

Guile twists and steps back. He stumbles and knoceks people.

An orc pushing guile. ,,YOU GO!''

Guile falls into  a couple humans wearing gray body suits, and the scatter.

Then hands grab Guile's arms and pull. The hands are covered with black govers and lead to black sleeves under silk long sleeed shirts.

Guile sees the sleeve looks like his Branching armor. He sees the people grabbing him wear masks.

Masks cloth and makeup covere the faces of the two reaching for Guile. The mask cover their eyes and forehead and have small horns rising above the eyebrows of the red mask. Red paint spread over narrow faces.

The two mask being click and clack and yank at Guile. 

Guile pulls and shakes. Sweat sprays. 

Guile cuioghs and snott sprays.

People spread around Guile and the two maske beings.

Spear hears Guile's sneeze and pushes through the crowd lead by Myst's sining.

Myst's song spreads.

People around Myst and beyond calm. Their shouts quiet. Their pushing and jostling calms. Their peers and scowls before looks and blinks. A few people relax their stance to see the fight and walk away toward distant sounds of drums, guitars and wild singing through the vast open market.

Myst hits her drum.

Her drum pounds. The drum pounds spread through the people.

The people step from Myst and Spear.

Spear pushes through and grabs one of the two masked being holding Guile. Spear lifts one maske being from the ground.

As the masked being rises above the ground, a loud wistle spreads like a siren.

The siren whines for the only sign.

A few people put their hand over their ears.

Myst hits drum hard, and the bommb of drums sooth the peircing sounds of the siren.

The siren tenses Spear's mucsles.

Spear throws the masked being to the ground and grabs Giule.

Guile swings arms and pushes away from Spear. ,,BACK!''

One of the two in red horned masks wedges and pries between people.

People glannce, look and step from Guile, Spear, Myst and the other red horned masked being.

Myst stops the beat. Her throat hums to show with sound and with echoes colors of all around. She whistles sharp like knife.

The red horned maked being screams a silent scream, slams hands against hears and falls to ground.

Spear grabs Guiles and throws Guile over shoulder.

Guile shits himself. The ring in Giule's mind sooths like a calm beat of a drum. A faint purr sooths pain in ankles and sore taut muscles. He hangs over Spear's shoulder.

Spear steps and walks from the puddle of piss and the people. 

The space behind is filled with a few wallking people mumble and pointinga.

,,Branching,'' mumbles Guile. His head flops, and body relaxes.

Myst smells the fumes aof shit and piss leadning her behind Spear as she hums.

The hum of Myst of Reighn spreads around the crowd. The mumbles become hums. The stares and peers become looks and glances as people step toward the wagons and the caravan.

The soldiers around the wagon carvan begins to click a cadence with step forward.

A long horn blows.
 
The the Wax of Myst and Spear, a black and red banner marches through the crowd toward the wagon and caravan. Black and red armored soldiers march under the black and red banner toward the wagon carvan.

Spear walks and shuffles through the people. 

Space opens to glass road and sand. People spread to small grouns and people walk along the road.

,,What do?'' says Spear.

Guile sniffs. ,,Stopped the wagons rolling.''

Spear steps and drops Guile to feet. ,,Can walk?''

,,Walk,'' says Guile pulling and pushing the branching armor. ''Can walk?'' He pulls on the branching armor and he feels it peel the poop from back side. He looks at his roabe over Spear.

,,Get you something to wear,'' Giule clears throat and spits.

Myst steps past Spear and Guile. ,,Time will not wait for you talk if we don't follow the leader of our song.'' She steps over the road and into the people at the side.

Spear and Guile follow Myst to the water pavillion.

Spear looks over the heads of people peering and starring for Kirra and William. ,,No William.''

Myst humms a soft tickling sound that sooths an itch through Guile's scalp as the walk toward the pavvillion...

Inside the pavillion stood and stands William and Kirra.

William hears Myst's drum through the song of Reighn plucking soft string in his mind. Kirra hears Myst's drum pound from the pavillion they stand as they stand inside.

Kirra and William are beyond the black sheet and inside the pavillion full of gnomes wearing hide pants with suspenders and thick hide coats lined with fur.

The black sheet and surrounded by black walls.

The black sheet and surrounded by black walls. Black walls sapn  on both sides along the line.

They stand side by side and stare around the long hall of black walls. 
 
A cool spreads over the sweat skin of Kirra and William.

Golden light glows from  globes hovering around the heads of a gnome wearing full plate and holding a hook-hamor.

Between the globes and illuminated soldiers stands other armored gnomes. 

The armored gnomes stand in the dark. 

Along the dark and beyond a few sihloueettes shines a dim light form a hole  in the black wall to Kirra and Wililam's wane. A few hugoblins wearing body tight suits with tubes rapping around waste to the shoulders. Goggles hang around their neck and backpack hang from shoulders.

The stand for a few seconds of silence as a sneeze throat clearing and mummbles spread through the hall.

Kirra says, ,,The hand. How it feel?''

William lifts the hand hand holds it before. 

The dim light from the golden globes shines from it's smooth surface.

,,Cold,'' says William. ''I feel as if my hand is cold and numb.'' He lowers hand. ''It feels like death and reminds me of death.''

They stand and the line moves. 

A low thump hits and spreads.

Kirra says, ,,Myst's drum.''

William stands and grabs the black sheet.

A gnome with swords raises words. Another gnome raises a crossbow. Another says, ,,You drop the door!''

William release the door and nods head a the gnome. ,,It is Myst's.''

They step forward and Wililams says, ,,It seems we may have time yet to meet the caravan. If it matters. I do wonder what will happen if we remain. Death? Fear?''

,,Trapped in desert,'' says Kirra. 

The black sheet parts for to hugoblins holding small heidls and shorts swords. Their red leather armor more brown. The black chain mail chipped and dull. The black sheet falls.

William says, ,,We go.''

The step and stand.

Then they stand.

A faint siren sings to William. ,,You hear they the high sound like a horn twisting?''

Kirra nods.

''Myst song of Reighn,'' says William.

Kirra glance at William. ,,Bad song? Good song?''

The song is a long sound that rises and lowers clearing all thorugh and string songs in William's mind.

,,Bad,'' says William. ''It is not bad for evil or threat, but bad like painful to hear.''

,,Emergency?'' says Kirra.

,,It may be, but unless you wish to incite these warriors listening and watching then I suggest we get the water and leave until it becomes a song of death.''

Kirra nods and they stand. William looks at his hand, feels the scare on throat, stands at attention and steps forward closer to the dim light and the window. Kirra holds her hand where her pinky is missing, she peers along the warriors she stands and lose her mind.

The sound  like a horn twisting stops.

,,I hope good,'' says Kirra.

The line moves and they steps near the window.

A gnome says and stands before William and Kirra. She pionts to William. ,,You stand at window. She will verify your order. Then you will proceed to collect the water.''

William nods and steps to the window.

A gnome with short parted white hairs, a smooth face and a tight blouse showing breat. 

William looks here in the her bright blue eyes while Kirra glances at her breasts.

She smiles at William and winks at Kirra.

Kirra looks at the guards. 

The guards standing near and under the light hold glance to stare at Kirra and Wililam.

The woman beynd the window says, ,,You order?''

William says, ,,Our order was for ten water sacks and ten glass water jugs. ''

The womain beyond the window nods, ,,You're payment?''

Kirra puts the glass cube on the window seal. 

The woman grabs the cup and lowers it behind the window.

A dim blue light shines from behind window over the womaman's face.

The Woman smiles and hold her palm before Kirra. ,,You will take the cube and follow the two guards on the other side of the door.''

The black wall to the Wax parts to dime gold light beyond. 

''Step on through to the other side,'' says the woman wiht a smile.

Kirra glances at the smile, the breasts the the two soldiers standing on either side of another black curtain.

William grabs the cart handles and rolls the cart isnide.

Two muscle thick gnomes yearing full plate and holding long hook hammers stand before William.

Around the warriors and William, Kirra, spans a a hall with doors to the wane. The to the wax. I a hall with one set of large double doors. Dim globes hover above the hall. 

The hall walls absort the light. 

One of the guard's muffled voice says, ,,Follow,'' and follows the wave of his own arm along the hall.

William pulls the wagon. 

The curtain falls. 

The sound of drums, shouts and chants quiet through the hollow echo of dark hall.

Kirra reaches and touches the wall. ,,Solid.'' 

,,HANDS TO SIDE,'' says a high scratchef voice from behind th other great helm.

The full plated guards scrape and clank along the hall and stand by the side of a door wide enough for a wagon.

One guard grabs the door and pulls whil the other stands.

The door open, and the guard standing says, ,,Your water is inside. You will see the water once the door closes. If you have complaints then return in the line where you made the purchase.''

The guards stands.

William looks to Kirra.

Kirra shurgs and steps to the door into the dark, and William follows.

,,A muffled voice says for great helm. ,,You back your water. You leave through door. We will close the door.''

The door shuts.

Four golden globes glow at corners of a wide square room. Behind the wagon is the wall with the door they entered. Before William and Kirra is a pile of block glass cubes, a pile of bags and a double wooden door. The wooden double door has a huge woode rod slide through two rings fastened to the ends of the wooden doors.

William says, ,,A room to trade the water and protect any from entering through the door to raid the place.''

Kirra nods. ,,Protect only thing worth life.''

,,Water,'' Says William.

William turns the cart. and lowers the handles. The cart platform s tops and the wheels and axles.

,,A stand,'' says Kirra. 

William shrugs shoulders and lifts the handles. ,,I will hold.''

Kirra flexes and nods. She unloads the wheels and axles. Then she leads the water.

The water sacks are as large as Willliams upper body and as heaves a  large rock. 

The water jugs are a square small key with a wax seal ards a spount near a bottom.

Kirra loads the jugs with ssweat and a few heaves. After three sacks tossed inside the cart, he says, ,,I'll hold cart.'' Her muscles stained and pulled. She grabs the cart handles.

William loads the remains seven sacks feel the heave water sack sway his step a few times. A few times he drops a water sack that splats agains the ground. The last sack hits the cart. 

The water sackes and cubes, the food fill the pottom of the cart and rise to a finger span under the glass walls of the cart.

William grabs a glass whell and says with a huff, ,,I believe our cart is full.'' He lays the wheel on the top water sacks and the glass containers. ''Maybe we should set the glass containers on the bottom and the sacks of food and water ont top. Then we can lay the wheels and axles on the top.''

Kirra shrugs.

William unloads the wagon, and puts the glass containers on the bottome then the sacks of water layerd by the food then the wheels and axle.

Sweat drips pools around William. ,,Thirsty he says with a huff.''

Kirra pulls on the handle. ,,Grap bwater skin. Drink. Get door.''

Wiliam grabs Kirra's water skin and drinsk walking with her to the door. He drops the water skin and pulls our the large wood rod from the door and opens the door.

Sounds of song, shouts and banter talk around and through. People stand and walk past. Afew glance at Willaim and Kirr and look at the cart of water.

A few gnome guards wearing studded leather and coil walk with gnomish hook hammers and talk with people walk along the wide path.

The wide path spans to the road and along a row of wooden and cloth goods. The tents and carts stand along the edige. A few people walk past.

A dwarf with a sack of water over should huff past. 

William pulls the cart and says, ,,We must watch the water.''

Kirra walks behind, says over a few people shouting over credit cost of a shoe. ,,No drums.''

,,Have shit piss bag,'' says Guile. ''Next shit piss body convulse from mind shock.''

William wipes sweat from forehead. ,,We all have our pouches.''

The both peer to the end of the water pavillion and near the road.

Spear stands by the entracne fence and gate.

They slowly move the short distance to the fence and gate as the two doors from the water room close.

,,SPEAR!'' shouts William.

Spear turns and sees William. He grabs Guile's shoulder and pushes. ,,We move.''

Myst follows.

The pack meets near edge.

Spear looks at Kirra. ,,Caravan stopped. Begin moving soon.''

Kirra nods.

William speaks to Spear as Spear turns back to William and looks over thepeople, across the road toward the caravan. William says, ,,We need to protect this water for I believe it be more precious that what ever credit we have.''

Spear steps. ,,We go. And look for branching because Guile was attacked by Branching.''

,,Branching,'' says Guile. ''Don't know if it was branching.'' He pulls on his shit stained branching armor looking from Spear to William to Spear. ''It could...It...''

Spear feels the chaos of covering of deciet from Guile steps and peers down at Guile. ,,You said branching. You feel branching.''

Kirra says from her stance behind cart. Guile says, Not branching and Love.''

,,I did. And that is what was said.'' His face goes taught. ''But I don't know.''

Spear huffs and staps the back of Guile and pulls Guile close lowing head. ,,You tell us what Love says.''

Guile lets the warmth of Spear's hand and the vibrations of Spear's voice to shout through mind and body and meet to form a pain dart that shoots through feels of thought at Spear.

Spear feels a tingle hit minds then spreads. His neck hurts where it bends. He stands and grabs Guile's neck. ,,Come.'' He steps back and looks at all. ''We walk.'' He jerks thick head across the road. ''We meet the caravan. And talk to Guile.''

,,Spear,'' says William. He glenches jaw and jerks on cart. ''We should let Guile speak before we squeeze it from him.'' He steps between Guile and William with cart behind, looks up to Spear. ''We talk about this as we walk.'' He looks at Guild. ''Stand and walk.''

Spear steps and bumps chests with William.

They stare.

People walk arond the pack. People holding cloth bundlers and baskets. A few hold water sacks and swords. A few poeople linger glances at the water in the wagon as seen through the sides of the cart.

Kirra peers their stares away.

,,William,'' says Myst. She hums, ,,Spear. Please find a commond song and sing along as we find our path. 

Myst's hum spreads between blinks of eyes to see the caravan lead shout. ,,FORMATION.'' and the soldiers fallin to line around the wagons.

Kirra hears the formation shout, says, ,,Spear!''

Spear slowly looks from William to Kirra.

Kirra looks at Spear. ,,Not worth your attention while walk.''

Kirr and Spear stare. Spear blinks, lowers hand, glares at Guile, glances at William and stands to the side of the wagon looking over the people.

,,William pulls,'' says Kirra. ''Guile, what don't you know?''

Guie steps by Myst.

Myst lowers her hum and crates a whistle.

The whistle spreads. A few people step away from Myst and the cart.

Myst steps with the wistel a a skinny path opens with people shaking hears and looking htis way and that way as they pause or step out of Myst's path.

Myst leads, and William pulls the cart to follow Myst. Guile steps between Myst and William fuming shit. Spear walks on the side as Kirra watches everywhere.

The small path sung from Myst spreads for the cart. The people spread and span as they pull the cart along the middle of the road toward a large mass of wagons and people jostling at the intersection of four large roads.

Fat smoke flows through the sweat stink and shit stink of Guile.

Sqwaking wagon wheels, mumlbes and a few coughs spreads. 

The whistle of myst fades before any hear between the sparse standing people.

Myst calms the wistle.

Kirra says, ,,Talk, Guile.''

Guile looks around, ,,They'll hear. They're everywhere.''

,,Talk,'' says Kirra.

William sweats. ,,Guile, speak now or you may be singing your last song with this group.''

Guile rubs scalp and pulls his few strands of hair behind his ear. He presses down on ankles. Pains spreads through mind. Guile focuse on the pain and spreads the pain to be a sphere then talks and thinks inside the pain. ,,Love said Brandhing, we call L and B. L only sees. L seen to me to have you leave. All leave with this caravan. L didn't see how. L didn't see need to pay for food water. L showed way. L set escape. L took William's body to Myst. L said William is to live.'' He looks back and around to the face of the pack before starring at the ground again. ''L said we'd be free. Except me. I...'' He looks back at William then looks to Myst. ''I remain. My mind part of hive.''

,,Hive?'' says William

,,Hive,'' says Guile. He stares at William. ''Hive is one mind of minds. All these voice. Talk and laugh. Helps you see things.''

Myst lowers tone and skips a step to walk with Guile.

,,They know your thoughts,'' says William. ''They now your thoughts now? How do they know your thoughts? Can they read mind?''

Guile looks back to Kirra and Spear then Myst. ,,I...The hive. ...He looks at ground spreading the pain sphere and following Myst soft whislter. ''Hive gets in mind. I let it in. Saved me from death. Got me alive once I gave showed Troll Death Moan. He looks at William then looks aheard. ''The don't read now. Maybe. I don't know. I ask for help stopping caravan. They laugh and laugh.''

,,A mind trator,'' says Spear.

Guile stops, turns a points while saying loud, ,,DON'T CALL ME.'' His chins shake and stabs finger at Spear on the otherside of the cart. ''You felt the purr. You wer
en't there. You with Love.''

Spear stops and scowls at Guile. His muscles flex.

,,Calm, Spear,'' says Kirra.

William says, ,,We all felt the purr of Love.'' He looks at Guile. ''Please continue your tell, Guile. Tell us where we go and why?'' He glares then look foward pushing the cart after Myst.

Myst whistles and spreads the song. 

The people spread a path for Myst that opens to a path for the cart.

Guile sniffs and pulls. His voice raises above the mumble, coughs and few moos of ox and blusters speaking form the nearing crowd of the intersection.

,,Hive are all the minds connected through mind. Don't know how they do it. It must be if one of the hive is close to another of the hive then the thought spans.'' He sniffs. ''Like web.'' All the thought connected. All thought going and coming. Many hear for I can feel it.'' He looks at Spear. ''They cans ee mind if I don't see pain.'' He glances at Wililam then looks forward to Myst. ''The hive still near. But I take my pain and numb the purr. Talk and think inside.'' 

The step a few steps, and William says, ,,What did Love tell you? Why do we travel this great desert? Why are we not being chased? Why did the shadow soldiers chase us the disappear?''

Guile snorts. ,,Love L...Love told me to get to the caravan. Act like a was sneaking on. Act like they didn't know, so you.'' He looks at William. ''So you would go aacross the desert with John the Goblinin.'' Guile pulls on shit stuck branching armor from butt while look wide eyed at William.

William's jaw clenches, and Myst's whistle stops.

''John the Goblinkin leads.'' Guile looks a Myst.

Myst hums and hears Guile talks, but sees with all sound the people and a path through the intersection. Through song, and the hum of throat, she sings the image of them to William and Guile and Kirra. The image they see...

Wagons trains rolling along the middle of the open wide road to a an interaction. Wagons rolls from the Rise, Wane, Set, and Wax of the pack. Glass, wood and steel wagons roll in rows and columns. Ox, goblincows, and workers pull the wagons. Horse riders and dog riders walk around the edges of wagon trains and shout point and guide the wagon trains through the intersection.

Wagon trains rolls into intersection wide as a pond. The intersection pond of people and woagons ripple and shifts as a wagon train enters. Guareds lead the wagon trains and create a path through the people and wagon intersection pond.

Guards wearigin red and green, black and orange; yellow and blue; gray and black; red and pink stand between intersecting wagons. Guaurds point at herdsman, riders and pack animals and shout, ,,I HAVE RIGHT OF WAY!'' Guards press small shield and flat sides of swords against shoulders and chests of wagon train workers and people.

People steps and weave between the wagon trains pull their hand carts on step at a time. People hold shout at the guards and glare at the wagons.

William, Guile and Kirra walk with Myst to the intersection. 

Spear walks with the sound seeing the same, but over the height.

Guile says, ,,You have a better way through the pass.''

Kirra say loud, ,,How do we join the caravan?''

,,I don't know,'' says Guile. ''Ghrended?''

William hears the song of Myst of Reighn sing to a melody of his string driven song. Myst's drum beat steps with his feat then pounds to his strings. His song plays.

,,It could be you need to speak with this Ghrend?''

,,No,'' says Guile. ''Love seen that we could sneak on and get lost in the caravan. The caravan big. I don't know. Seen Love. Love won't see back.''

,,Hive help,'' says Kirra.

,,Don't know,'' says Guile. Guile looks at Myst and looks at Spear.

,,And branching,'' says Spear. Spear peers along the crowd watching and feeling the movements of the people around shift and sit. He sees the the lay of the land through sight and feeling of the talk not to distant to his own mind. Spear sees the area.

Kirrra says loud. ,,We get sheet for cover to covere from sun and Branching. WE get fast. I buy bundle coths.''

William glances back at Kirra. ,,I shall go. I can complete the mission and return.''

,,No,'' says Kirra. Kirra looks to Spear.

Spear nods, slows step and walks behind the wagon. 

Guile sniffs and watches Kirra enter the crowd then looks at William. ,,Only want to help the pack, us. Love...''

William pulls the cart and sweats. ,,Love has plans for us if we Love. Love always wants more.'' William clenches jaw and pulls the wagon after Myst.

Myst leads with song thorugh the large intersection. She sings tones between grous and a few carts. She hums and makes the lead cows of a cattle train clomp and stop allow their cart to pass. She taps on drum setting beat. 

William sweats and breathes. He feels his muscles numb with flexing. 

Spear watches, and near the middle he grabs and squeezes an arm of a human. 

The human slides slick arm from his grasp and disspaears through the crowd.

Guile looks here and there looking and peering for the people as his shit fumes spread.

Half way through the intersection, Myst slows her thumps to slow taps. 

People squeese and push and spreads. They jostle Rise, Wane, Set Wax. A cow moos. A bell rings.

Myst, William, Spear start in the middle.

Spear peers over the people and scans heads looking for purple/yellow armor and the mounte Ghrend.

Ghreand rides above the crowd on the back of the an ox-goblins. 

Ghren and the train move toward their Rise and to the Rise of Spear and the pack.

,,To the Rise,'' says Spear. ''They move.''

William huffs and nods. Sweat drips from nose and chin. '''Yes.''

Myst steps. William pulls. Guile looks here - there!  and behind back looking around. The sphere of ankle pain holds his thought and the talk. ,,Kirra know.''

,,Kirra find us,'' says Spear.

Kirra leaves the cart and finds a vender on the Wane side of the road selling desert robes before the cart enters the thick crowd of the center.

But the time Myst slows here drum taps, Kirra finds robes and glasses, scrafs for desert travel. She stands before a halfing hearig a tan robe.

The robe's hanging sleeves curcle wrists and end of gloves. The halfing wears a leather coif with aa pari fo black glasses, like herns, glasses, hanging around neck. White circles surround the hafling's eyes.

Kirra looks down.


The halfing smiles. ,,I am Lorna. Here you see laid out are my cloaks and goggles made by my family and the best in all the selles market.''

A human pushes agians Kirra and says, ,,I need a cloak.''

Kirra pushes the human back with shoulders, grabs daggers, and peers at the human.

The human, man wearing trousers, jacekt and a belt step from Kirra.

Kirra looks a t Loran. ,,Three big cloaks. Four medium cloas. Four scarfs. Five blankets big to cover wagon.'' She points to the goggles hanging around Lorna's neck. ''Five goggles dark.''

Lorna smiles. ,,Ah, an adventure of the desert. Need you be needed a map? An eagle eye to see.''

Kirra stares. ,,Hurry.'' She glances at the mass of people at the intersections center. ''Need to get to caravan.''

Loren's wide stare sinks to eyelids near close. She snorts. ,,A hurry you are in.'' She shakes head. ''Always in a hurry. Never enough time to wonder what one may need when in the desert.'' Loren snaps fingers.

A halfing wearing a long fur scarf and along coat that hands from head to shouders. A fur hat with a racoon face stares from atop haflings head.

Loren says, ,,Hooonj, get this person's items.'' She opens hand to have a flat palm. ''I will need 3,133 credits.''

,,No. 3,000.'' says KIrra. She ppers and grabs the hilt of her sword.

Loren smiles. ,,Your swords will only slay me. Not the five warriors standing ner year.

A couple of humans stand around Kirra step from kirra.

Five halflings wearing chain shirts and holding daggers step around Kirra.

Kirra slides hand from hold to bag and tosses cube to Loren's palm.

Loren leaves and returns with a big bundle. She tosses it on ground and hold the glass credit cube between fingers. ,,You have only thirty-three credits left to spend.'' She smile and tosses the cube at Kirra.

Kirra catches the cube. Kirra grabs the bundle, throws the bundle and robe tied to the bundle over shoulder and walks toward the wagon train lead by Ghrend.

,,GOOD JOURNIES!'' shouts Loren.

Kirra steps and walks to boxes stacked near a booth of cermaic bolws and cubs. She walks the boxes and sees over the crowd and looks for the wagon train of Ghrend.

The wagon train lead by Ghrend pushes, jolts and rolls into the intersection. Ghrend shouts and points. Purple and yellow guards pushe people and make a path through.

 Another smaller wagon trains bisects Ghrend's. Pruple and yellow warriors shouts and points swords at green and brown warriors.

Kirra feels a push and a poke of a swords tip.

One shouts,, ,,YOU GET DOWN!''

Kirra slides short sword from sheath, turns and slaps aside a short swords, circles her blade and pulls the short sword from the hand a halfing wering a chained shirt.

Two other halfing step from behind the disarmed halfling. 

Kirra smils and leaps from boxes and into the crowd. ,,Fight!'' she shouts.

The people spreads. The people quiet. Only the distant music, moos and calls from an auction speak.

Kirra and the two halfing guards stares.

,,JJoolo and Haarlink, you yeild,''  says Loren.

Kirra smiles and steps back, bumps people.

People spread her a path, and Kirra walks away with sword tip ready to strike and sight seeing even thos behind. Ten steps from the two guards she lowers swords and walks through the crowd toward Ghrend's wagon train.

Myst, Guile, William and Sper stand near the wagon train of Ghrend.

A few yellow and purlple soldiers push people into Myst's space. 

William pushes the cart.

Guile look between people, behind, before and around. He sneezes and wipes nose with forearm. He sends a shout. The shout shakes his skull and spin. The shakes spreads pain. Guile stops to a stands and falls to a knee.

The cart hits Guile.

William stops, huffs, sweats. ,,Stand, Guile. We must.''

Myst slows her hum and tabs her drum. She steps and kneel by Guile and breathes a hum near Guile's hear. She sings. ,,Rise to be with and walk. Follow the songs talk. For many we have fought. And much we have bought. Our destiny complete is not.'' 

The song creates a breeze of the shock thorugh Guile. His ankle pain sooths, and the thought sphere of pain spreads to thoughts of a maze for Guile.

The song sings to William and strikes the cords of William. 

William's song of slow plucking bass strings rise the scale and pluck with feet. Then the pluck increases tempo. 

Guile stands. William pulls. Spear looks thorugh crowd for Branching, yellow and purple guards and Kirra.

Spear turns and stars at Kirra. ,,Kirra.''

William looks back at Kirra.

Kirra pushes and pulls body and cloth bundle through crowd. 

A few hugoblins warriors wearing sand covered brown studded leather [ut hand on hilts. One grabs Kirra and clicks and clack.

Kirra steps around. Bag swings and hits Spear.

Spear steps and flexes. He smiles and peers at the hugoblins warriors.

William stands and blows sweat from nose while Myst stands and hums.

The one hugoblins warrior release its hold and steps from Kirra. Both look between the trio and step aways.

William, Spear and Kirra peer and look around the ground.

People around glance the look forward. They pull one carts, grip packs, pull on ropes, hold harnesses. The people look through the crowds beyond.

Beyond people spread from the crowd.

The light above shines bright.

The three warriors of the pack watch the hugoblins push through the people.

Myst hits drum and hits a steady beat. 

Kirra tosses cloth bundle on back of cart, steps and stand near Willia. ,,I pull.''

William shrugs shoulders and nods head back. He sweats, flexes and pills the cart to Myst.

Myst tabs beat. She leads winding by carts a stone's throw from the wagon train of Ghrend.

The Ghrend's wagon train roll slow through the intersection and to the wide open road to the Rise of the Myst. The guards begin to march step, and the wheel begin to roll. 

Five wagon trains and a few hand carts pull from the intersection through the people and toward a tall galls hall. The road spans into the hall.

William pulls into the open space, and Myst hits her drums, and the cart rolls parrallel between the spraning market and the great opening before.

Guile coughs, and snott falls. He says, ,,It that-'' He sneezes. ''Is that to the surface?''

William sweat and shurgs. Myst taps drum.

Spear shrugs.

Kirra says, ,,Ask one.''

Ghrend's wagon train trails a long taill with five wagon spaces between carts. The guards march in four square between the carts. 

Carts and wagosn pull along the center of the road. The road spreads to edge with sparce peopel and booths. Open space between the markets spreads. People become few.

Large pavillions spread from the booths and people as the people and the crrows change from people to wagons, cows and sand coved beings. Cow bells, shouts, moos and clicks and clacks shout from herds and clusters of cows and wagons.

Sand, shit and piss puddles scatter over the ground left by wagons and carts rolling from a great hall as wide and as tall as the road. The great hall spans from the into the dark. 

Wagons pull from the great hall and guide toward pavillion along the sides of rows. Carts roll into the caravan and the trains stops. 

One long wagon train rolls between the pack and Ghrend's wagon train. Hugoblins waring white robes and masks walk with the oxen and gobon cows. Sand fells a path of a trail. Exposed faces crack with sun brunt. Eyes stare the long stare. Shoulders ares slumped and hands hang side. The oxen and goblin cows walk with heads hung and ribes wrapped with skin. The wood and glass wagons are covered with cloth. Guards of green and black march with the wagon.

A green and black four square of guards step the march close to the pack.

Spear steps near. 

And the guards back off. 

Guile steps away, ,,We we go?''

,,Talk with branching,'' says Spear.

Kirra smirks. 

William pulls. ,,See the mind turst,'' 

Guile sniffs and says at a halfling walk to past with three halfling looking hugoblins, ,,You tell me where the road...''

The group glances at Guile and walks toward the intersection.

Myst hums and pounds, ,,We follow the caravan. We follow a nother.''

William huffs and pulls. ,,If we march on we can find where they go. They may be looking for us. We best remain near the back. Hide.''

Spear grunts and steps.

William glances back and pulls the wagon forward following Myst.

The long wagon train passses, and the pack and Ghrend's carvan are roll along the center of the road into the great hall.

As Ghrend's wagon train enters the great hall, Myst slows the drum tap. William slows the pull and walks a quick sprint behind.

Another wagon train of four rolls behind. 

Beyond the thresshold of the greate walls span columns of wagons resting side by side.

Guile sniffs. ,,A queue.'' 

Twenty queues span long and short, side by side, between glass fenses that rise from the ground to the wax of hte pack. To the wane, and covering the other half of the road is an open area of carts that roll from queues past the pack and into the sun light market behind.

Afore, wagons roll toward one of the twenty queues create by fences.  The feneses span parallel to small black boxes and seperate carts and wagons.

Ghrend's wagong train rolls to a wagon column that is near the wax wall.

William stops and stands. ,,What path do we take?''

Guile sniffs. ,,Cart queue. Far wall.''

,,Minds of Love tell you,'' says Kirra.

,,No.'' Guile looks back. ''No. I...just. It's closest to the Ghrend. It's short. We...''

William grabs the cart poles and pulls the cart leading the pack to the far row against the wall. He grunts. ,,We wait. We follow Ghrend. Guile will get us through.''
 
Guile sniffs. ,,I can...I can see with the trust. I can. I will...'' He looks to the ground and feels for the purr, but feels only a slight pain throb mind.

Spear and Kirra follow walking close near the back.

Kirra grabs the bundle and pulls a white robe from the bunde.    

The bundle flops open.

William looks back. ,,Kirra has the right mind to wanto to cover. Ghrend did see us. And if we are to be considered runaway warriors it could be seen. It may be best if Spear, Kirra...'' He pause stops. ''And I enter.'' He stands with back to the end of Ghrend's caravan.

A few yellow and purple guards peer at the pack.

,,Guile says they want us to tavel desert.'' say Spear. He folds arms.

Guile shifts and pulls a robe from the cart and throws over shoulders. The robe spreads over the ground.

Kirra grabs a robe and tosses it on Guile. ,,Smaller.''

While changing to the small robe. ,,L...'' He looks behind and lowers voice. ''Love and Senator doesn't want to know of plan. There are forces to stop us.''

,,Branching?'' says Spear.

,,No,'' says Guile. He tosses other robe on cart. ''The magic users.'' 

William grabs the cloak tosse by Guile and says, ,,What if we tell them when we are caught?''
Guile sniffs. ,,Who will they belive?''

William nods and pulls robe over shoulders and hood over head.

The pack dresses in robes.


(THE PULL ALONG LINE TO THE EXIT AHEAD OF GHREND)



A red and black guard says, ,,How much water?''

,,What says William?''

,,Water. You have water. How much water do you have?''

,,WE have enough to drink for the trip across the desert,'' says William.

Another two guards steps toward the packs exit gate.

Guile looks back to Ghrend's

,,You owe a water tax,'' says the Guard. He puts hand on short sword hilt.

,,Water tax?'' sniffs Guile. ''We paid for our water. We own it. We paid tax,'' He steps to the guard.

The guard points afinger and taps Guile chest. ,,You. Pay.'' The guard clicks.

Guile and Kirra understand the click as meaning Help in surface talk.

,,You pay water tax,'' says the guard. ''You leave city with water. You pay the tax.''

William cleaches steel hand forms fist and faces stares, and Myst humms. The hums strikes a cord in William's mind. The cord spreads through William, and William release fist and says, ,,We are merely warriors wishing to seek adventure beyond the sands.''

The guard, smirks and spreads an arm over the crowd, ,,All these people are warriors looking for adventure.'' He looks at William. ''All pay the water tax if they leave with water.''

The guards behind click and clack.

,,How much tax?'' says Guile. He sniffs. 

The solders snners at Guile. ,,You pay thirty credits.''

Kirra clenches glass cube and tosses it to the guards. 

The guard catches the cube and walks to the end of the fense. He pulls a leather sack from the end of the fence.

A red light glows from the end of the fence.

The guard waves cube over red light.

The red light turns blue.

The guards says, ,,You go,'' tosses the cube and waves arm.

William hears the guitar stick the cords as he pulls the cart from the fense queque.

Beyond the Queue, wagons and carts rest in rows as guards wearing black and red search bundles and stacks in wagon and carts. Guards talk to sun burn travellers and surround a giant gobling shouting and pointing at a dead ox. A herd of Ox stomp and stand in a corral of wagons waiting and standing. Beyond the queue is a que of sand cvoered wagons talking with guards.

Guards stand round black black structures like outhouses. The wander and peer. 

Behind the pack, Ghrend's wagon trail rolls to the end of the fense. Ghrend dispounts from the ox-bull and talks with guards. Wagons and carts pull their loads from the fenses' queues and rolls with the pack to a Rise direction of dim dark.

The pack rolls forward.

The dim dark become dim light. 

Kirra says, ,,Mind trust tell us what to do?''

Guile rubs nose. ,,I...'' He looks at William. ''I...Can't. Mind hurts. Head throbs.''

,,We follow,'' says Kirra. ''The lead.'' She steps to Guile and looks down. Her hilt grabs hand. ''You talk with Ghrend.''

,,I.'' Giule steps back and sniff. ''I...Love said they would know. But. I...What if...''

,,Talk,'' says Spear. He stand and stares.

Guile shifts legs to pull poop from butt and itch. ,,I need.''

,,Talk to Ghrend,'' says Kirra.

William hold the cart balanced. Sweat drops. ,,Kirra, Spear, Please let Guile speak before we assume he is able to do anything.'' William pulls the cart a circle and pulls to stand by Kirra and Spear. ''Guile. What dod Love says about joining the Caravan for if she did not tell you when anad were and how to join then our journey ends here.''

,,And pack ends here,'' says Spear.

Kirra says, ,,Don't need dead weight.'' She looks to Ghrend's wagon train to the Guile.

The wagon train rests behind the gate of the fense. Guards walk along side the wagons and peers under the cloths. Ghrend talks with the guards, and all laugh.

Guile sniffs and stares at Kirra. He sends a mental shout through his own mind clearing sense, creating dark, freeing pain and opening his mind. Guile snifs and looks to William.

William says, ,,There should be no talk of our ending a pack that has endured more than unions between family and brothers.'' William looks to Spear, Kirra, Myst and Guile. ''Guile,'' He closes eyes and lets the guitar strings soothing with a soft plucks. He opens eyes to look at Guile. ''Can you remember what we are to do? We need to know for our path may end here if we do not join this caravan-''

,,If a caravan be,'' says Spear.

William continues to look at Guile. ,,We need to know Love wants you to think though it may be a lie or a trap.''

Guile sniffs.

Spear stares down at Guile.

Kirra looks at the queues and Ghrend.

Ghrend stands by guards.

The guards of Ghrend's wagon train click and clack loud. One guard shouts. ,,WE SEE.''

The guard talking with Ghrend nods, smiles and slaps Ghrend on the shoulder.

Ghrend smiles and nods heads, smiles and raises arms.

The gate opens; the ox pull wagons and wagons roll.

Kirra looks from Ghrend's wagon train to William. ,,We need to act now. No talk. Ghrend moves.''

Ghrend's wagon train slowly pulls from the queue fense. Ghrend stands by the fense exist and guards talking and gesticalting with the guards of black and red.

The wagon train rolls toward the pack.

Kirra says, ,,Go talk.''

Spear sniffs and stares. 

Guile looks at Myst. ,,I remember. She said. I think. I...'' He tries to focus thought, but feels pain. ''I thinks she said Ghrend will know. I tried.''

William looks at Myst.

Spear looks at Myst.

Kirra looks at the wagon. 

The wagon train rolls.

Myst hums to a talk like a song, ,,Guile, we need you to be strong and help guide us to our path as you are the only one that knows what needs to be done.''

Guile snaps. ,,I don't. I Can't think. I.''

,,Guile,,'' sooths Myst's voice like a purr thorugh body. ''You not go along though we may find a place to view. We will be with you. We will.''

,,What am i,'' says Guile. He sneezes.  

Kirra huffs. ,,Weak.''

Guile stares red faced at Kirra.

William grabs Guile's shoulders.Guile flinches away.   

William says, ,,You have the strength enough to find a story and a tone to talk with Ghrend or din the way thorugh the past.'' He stares guile to calm. ''You have been through worse, Guile. You have faced more pain and suffering than Ghrend or any guard standing around.'' 

Guile's face calms to a pasty tone. His body shakes calm and stare looks away to Ghrend.

''Talk,'' says Willam. ''We will wait and ready to come to your aid if we need to help.''

Guile thinks of the contract and slides his hand into a pocket and grabs the piece of paper. ,,I...'' He looks at Myst and Willia. ''I go.'' He steps from the pack and toward Ghrend holding his contract with Love.

Guile grabs the folded contract in Branching armor pocket and glances at the shadows for Branching members while fuming shit and walking toward the wagon train and Ghrend. He glances back and sees...

William pull the cart and lead the pack from the path of the caravans exiting the glass city. 

Forward he walks and steps aside making a path for a couple yellow and purple soldiers. An ox blusters snott, and snott hits Guile.

A guard pushes Guile with small shield. 

Guile stumbles away. He sniffs his shit sense.

A couple black and red guards steps toward Guile as the wagon train rolls past.

One guard clicks. One says and points twoard the pack and the direction of the rolling wagon and cart trains leaving the fense. ,,You go wrong direction. You stop.''

Guile steps toward Ghrend and the two guards by Ghrend.

''YOU STOP,'' shouts the talking guard.

Short swords slide for sheaths. Shields rise. 

Guile pulls contract sheet from pocket and shouts. ,,GHREND! I HAVE A CONTACT WITH LOVE!''

One soldiers grabs Guile while the other slams small shield in Guile's face. 

Guile stumbles  and hits two yellow and purple guards. Guile's nose bloods. He shout. ,,GHREND!''

Ghrend nods at the guards near the fense, folds arms and walks toward Guile.

Guile holds the contract high and falls to ground.

A yellow and purple guards kicks guile.

Ghrend clicks and clacks to a couple yellow and purple guards.

The yellow and purple guards run from the wagon trains and stands strides away holding swords and shield. 

A dwarf on a oxgoblin shouts, ,,GHREND!'' She pulls on reighns on oxgoblin. 

Ghrend raise and waves arms foward. ,,MOVE.''

The dwarf on oxgoblin whips reighns. The oxgoblin and wagon train roll forward.

Ghrend stands above Guile, looks down and folds arms. His gruff voice says, ,,Love? Love? Who's love. And. And what.'' His bread bounces has his head moves to look from guards to Guile and guards and Guile. ''You. You have a contract. What, what contract. You

,,I am Guile,'' says Guile as he pushes eblows and arms to sit.

Ghrend's foot pushes Guile's shoulder, and Guile falls to the rough glass ground. The warriors and guards around Ghrend laughs.

One soldiers clicks wiht another. And a purple and yellow guard says, ,,You contract with Love.'' The hugobling guard laughs.

Ghrend snaps to all pointing thick stubby finger at the yellow and purple guards. ,,You march with the wagon to the rendeuvous.'' He peers at the two black and red solders, sigh. ,,I be talking with this one about spreading lies.''

One red and black soldiers snorts a laugh. ,,You need help, Ghrend, changing this baby's diaper. I get the woman here.''

,,Stinky,'' says the other soldier as both step from Guile, Ghrend and the wagons. 

Guile sniffs and wipes strains of sticky hear from forehead. He grabs the peice of paper and holds in to Ghrend.

Ghrend folds arms and looks along wagoin train. He says. ,,You speak the wrong names out loud.'' He pauses. 

Guile stares.

The pack watche from a far. William says, ,,We may need to help for I see they are assulting him.''

,,We wait,'' says Spear.

,,We move,'' says Kirra. She kneels by wheel. ''Don't stare William.''

Wililam looks away from Guile and Ghrend.

Myst says, ,,I will see,'' and she humms. 

Myst's hum spreads through the wagons, carts and beasts to Guile and Ghrend a long stone throw away. While the sight of Spear, Kirra and Wililam is blocked by beasts and wagons rolling to and fro mthe Guile, Myst's hum sees around Guile and Ghrend.

Ghrend and Guile remain in position. 

Ghrend looks from line of guards and wagons to Guile. 

Guile raises the foldied sheet of the contract, and whipes the paper for it to unfold then holds it above. . ,,I...''

Ghrend lowers and swipes the parchment, glances at the paper and tosses the paper to guild.

The papper falls on Guile..

,,Blank,'' says Ghrend.

,,Blank,'' says Guile. He grabs the parchment and stares, peers, rubs hands over  a blank parchment. ''It was...''

,,You stick, boy,'' says Ghrend.

A oxgoblins blusters, and the last wagon rolls past.

,,Contract...'' Guile looks to the paper and to Ghren. ''The paper...''

Ghrend gruffs and sniffs. ,,You stink.'' He stands full hight and walks from Guile after the wagon.

,,I am Giule from Love. I was...'' He rolls to side and sniffs. ''I,'' he coughs and finds feet. ''I am Giule. I...''

Ghrend stops walk.

One on an oxgoblin at the end of the wagon train yells, ,,GHREND. YOU RIDE!'' A few laugh.

Ghrend says loud and doesn't turn back. ,,Another steel fist to take across the desert.'' He storts and spits with out looking at Guile. ''Get your steel hand friend. Rid in holding by 5. Stay out of sight.'' Ghrend pushes hand in pocket and tosses a copper coin to Guile. ''Clean yourself. Stink.'' He steps and leaves loud words. ''We leave after these wagons arrive.''

The copper coin bounces near Guile. 

Ghrend shout, ''YOU LEAVE ME BEGGAR!''

Guile opens the paper.

White blank spreads over paper

A purr spreads thorugh his head. The Love's laughter spreads to a sight seen in his mind. >You pudgy pet. You think you have a contract to give reason.< Her voice talks to mummble and noise of mayn whispering shouting laughing. The laughing settles through the purr.

The purr through Guile's mind numbs body and scatters through and draws Guile.

Guile senses shift from shits stick and smell, ankle pain, rage at contract, cold of floor, hunger, thrist become spread through the span of voices and throughs shifting colors and lights for shapes and seense.

A boot kicks Guile's stommach. ,,YOU STAND. YOU WALK!'' shouts a black and red soldiers. 

Guile's purr flashes and pops. Guile's stomch jiggles. Guile coughs. 

Two blakc and red soldeirs stand above.

From the distant, William clenches steel fists and grabs steel hilt. ,,I may be one...''

,,Stay!'' says Kirra. ''Watch before we see. No sword. Don't know what Guile needs.''

,,Our help,'' says William.

Myst hums and says, ,,We must trust in Guile to perform the song needed to find the next note, William.''

...And Guile' coughs, rolls to knees. He thinks to shout and kill the soldier, but the purr of Love and buzz of pain shatter thoguht. Guile does move, roll and stand with paper.

A few soldiers laugh and click as Guile walks to the pack. The laughter spread through Guile's mind and the purr.

The purr of Love's Mind Trust shakes his mind, spreads pain, blocks senses as Guie stands before the pack.

Guile's waves and sways.

Myst feels the vibration of the sing discorse from his being. Myst speaks and does sing, ,,Guile if you guide. I will find. A path of you to follow...''

And for Guile the pain clears. The wrinkles on brow spread. He blinks and sees. ,,I...I...'' Guile sniffs, looks at the pack and glances at the wagon train. ''Five. We meet in five. We go now. They leave soon.''

,,Love,'' says Kirra.

,,Don't know. He...'' Guile puts hand on gut and clenches copper peice. ''He said five. No love talk. No...''

William grips the cart pulls. ,,And do we need to pay more tax to enter this stagging area?'' He clances back at Guile. ''Willi these guards know? What will be happening. Can't anyone come along?'' He pulls.

Guile shovers the crumpled blank parchment and shoves it in the branching armor. He sniffs. ,,Don't know. Only know go here.''

Speaer huffs. Kirra grabs bundle of cloth. ,,Robes. Wear.'' She grabs one and shakes looks from bundler. '''Blanket cover.''

Guile nods. ,,Yes. Yes. Goood iead.''

,,No hiding,'' says Spear.

,,We hide,'' says William, glances at Spear, looks forward. ''We do not know who or what will be in the caravans. If you know who and what are going to be in the caravan then please lead the way. But when you find one who knows you then please do speak of the pack as we will need it to attack.''

Spear shrugs shoulder and nods head back. He walks fast and steady with the cart.

,,Where?'' says Kirra.

,,Five...Five.'' Guile sniffs and walks near William.

The pack rolls along through road through the dim hall. Golden globs over a tower's heigh above. Beyond the glow is the dark that appears to never ends. The golden glow radiates people rolling along with wagons and carts. Some roll with the pack and pther roll from the pack. 

Soldiers walk in packs of four peering at the carts, wagon and people and surrounding those people standing away from the queues. Soldiers stand around black boxes near large arches.

The large arches rises as high as the golden globes and lead to darkenss. At the top of the arche is etched goblins markings. 

Golden light shines on Ghrend's wagon train rolls along the halls.

Ghrend's wagon train rolls slow along the halls. 

Guile peers at the markings saying, ,,Five, five...''

,,What words are you speaking and repeating for the play an old song.''

Guile sniffs. ,,Ghrend said we go to five. Five.''

,,We follow,'' says Spear. ''We enter.'' He pulls the robe of Riegh from body, walks naked a few steps as he throws another robe over body. 

Guile looks at Spear's naked body and grabs his robe. ,,We don't want to be seen.''

,,Who?'' says Spear. He snorts and slams fist on palm. ''We hurt them.''

,,No. No. I.'' He looks from side to side. ''I think there is somethings. He said. '' He looks at William. ''Can we slow down. They're...''

William smiles and blows. Sweat blows from nose. ,,You can pull your speed if you know your speed.'' 

Above a large arch way is the number five casting shadows over the glass.

,,Five.'' He points hight above to the large number. ''Five. Five there.'' He sniffs.

,,Ghrend rolls on.'' says Kirra. 

Spear steps. ,,We follow Ghrend.''

,,No.'' Guile stands and points at the large five etched above the arch. ''Five. Ghrend says go to Five. That's five. Five. Goblins scratch. But five.'' His face shakes, shades of red spread. Eyes peer at Spear.

William breathes and stops. He glares at Guile. 

Guile looks at William. ,,Five.''

William sweats. William shrugs shoulders and nods head back and looks at Spear. ''I believe we should enter through five. If we are not able to enter then we-''

,,We are trapped,'' says Spear. He glares at Guile. ''Why not follow Ghrend?''

Guile snorts, sniffs and clears throat and spits at Spear's feet. He looks at Spear. ''I don't know. I've never journied across the desert.''

Spear grabs Guiles.

William says, ,,Spear!''

Spear holds Guile's neck with his huge hands. His eyes glares wide. Hand squeezes.

,,Spear,'' says Kirra.

Spear blinks and looks at Kirra. His hand releases grips, but holds grasp.

Guile's neck musles and shift with jaw and neck. Claws grow from hand and hs swipes Spear's forearm.

Spear pushes Guile away as Guile's snout extends. Two hugoblins holding large backs and covered with body suits stand and glance at Guile.

Guile slikes by their feet. They walked past.

Guile leaps to feet, punces over gournd and arms extend and shoulders.

Spear raises arms and steps at Guile.

Kirra steps before spear and pushes him back. ,,No.''

William jerks cart before Guile.

Four soldiers step from black box near the entrance to the arch under five. They click and clack.

Guile steps leaps long and grabs on to the side of the cart. 

Spear slows step, bumpes Kirra into the cart. 

William holds the cart and says, ,,A song to sooth the beast.''

Myst smils and hums. The hum flows and spreads tight muscles loose, pounding hearts to beat. She quickly raps the edges of drums. 

Drum pounds and rolls and thumps through. 

With her hum, Guile's muscles relax. With the pounds, Her feet and hands releae from the cart and he drops to the ground. 

Guile hears the song. The pain in head sooths. He feels the muscis and sees Spear.

Spear flexes and grabs to nudge aside Kirra and grabs the back of the cart.

Kirra pushes away Spear's arm from cart and pushes Spear back.

Spear steps and flexes and peers through Kirra.

,,Calm, Spear,'' says Kirra.

William says, ,,ENOUGH PLAY OF YOU CHILDISH GAME.''

Soldiers four wearing black chain main and black studded leather hold swords and shield.

Myst raps along the drum and flows her hum to the words. ,,We fight for the right of our might, so might give a fright without light or our sight...'' She trails the I for IIIIIII... and raises arms above head.

Two of the soldiers slow their walk and smile and point with sword tip then lower swords. They click and clack.

The other two soldiers slow jog and click an clack boac and wave swords at the pack.

The pack stands a sprint from the guards.

William says after Myst's iiii''s go sinlent. ,,And I hope we are not dopes for get out the rope and acid soap to let the prisoners grope our bodies.''

Spear looks at William feeling rage discourse with confusion. 

Kirra preeses hand agains Spear. ,,Wait.'' She says calm.

Spear breathes and stares at the soldiers. He shrugs shoulders and nods head back. He glares at Guile.

Guile smiles and stands at height almost a head taller. His face is a pout of a snouth. Thin air whispes around face. Hearing the chainamil of the soldiers, Guile steps twoward the soliders and Myst.

Myst smiles and steps at the soldiers. ,,With music we express ourselves beyond the voilence.

Two of the soldiers step at Myst and William with shield and swords raises. One says loud, ,,You move along. You be quiet.'' The other sneers.

The two soldiers behind stands and step to Myst. On says, ,,You sing of Tune.'' The other guards smiles and tries to hum. 

William says loud, grabbing the cart and pushing back and walk backeward along the all with a five above the arche. ''We are on our way.''

The cart rolls back and William walks between Guile and Kirra with Spear stepping back and peering at Guile. 

Spear's arm bleeds.

The two soldiers bow at Myst and one says, ,,For Tune I sing.'' The soldier begins to click and clack rhythms. 

Myst taps the side of her drums with the clicks and clacks of the soldier. 

The other soldier near Myst taps his feet with Myst's beat and snaps mouth with his soldier friend.

The other two soldiers look back at their entertaining fellow soliders. One of the armed soldeiers clicks and clacks and points to the box. The other peers at Willaim and Spear, Guile and walks backward with the other. Both the two armed soldiers  nudge the clicking and dancing soldier. 

Myst slows her drum.

And the other two soldiers slow the song and dance. Then all the soldiers click and clack ans snap liek screams.

Myst bows and steps away with a hum as the four soldiers point and shout click and clacks.

William turns the cart around and pulls the cart along the wide hall.

The wide and hall leads to a bright light a pond's lenght away. The dark glass walls raise to an arch above. At the top of the arch, a line of globes float and glow an golden light that spreads to near dark at the bottom of hte hall. 

A dense smoke swirls from the light and hovers around the golden globes. The haze feels to stick and spreads sweat piss and dust smell spreading. 

A few cart pullers and bag haulers walk with the pack along the hall to the light and through the haze. 

Sihlouettes of beasts and man; carts and wagons shift and flow. 

A few coughs and a clam constant chatter talks through the hall.

William pulls their cart toward the light and through the haze. Spear and Kirra walk on one side. Myst and Guile on the other. Sweat drips from William's forehead.

William says, ,,By Reighn we will all die in the desert if we can not become a pack again.''

Guile breathes and walks on two tips stepping quick and sure. His smirk spreads wide over snout and lets a squeek. 

Wiliam says, ,,Guile, you may find you will be believed if you refraine from trying to...''

Guile squeeks a voice. ,,You lead a mindless muscle.''

,,Control own mind,'' says Spear. He looks over th eGuile.

Kirra stares Spear's stare at Guile to look forward. ,,Together,'' says Kirra. She looks at Guile, William then Myst. ''Myst lead. Too many leaders.''

Guile squeek talks. ,,Don't need the muscle.''

,,Only my hand and alive is what you probably need or care to have for it is what i  getting you waht you want.''

,,The troll deathmoan,'' says Guile. ''Got me my needs. Now I need...'' Guile shakes head and stares forward.

The sihlouettes spread and become being. The haze smoke swirls and light spands.

A line of ox goblins shift and settle. Mutterings of surface talk spread through the haze.

lines of carts, beastss and people stand in lines into the haze and dim light. To the wax and wane of the pack, lines of beasts and people queue, stop and wait.

The animals wait and stand with carts harnessed or near head. A few oxgoblins shit and piss then stomp the waste into the ground. Puddle splash. 

William pulls the cart to the back of an oxgoblins harnessed to the back of a wood wagon. Two hugoblins wearing sheets, makses and glasses stand on the side of the cows.

To the Wax, a row of glass wagons pulled by white sheets rolls to a stop. 

The the Wane, a couple of being covered with sheets from head to toe stand.

Spear says, ,,Five.'' Blood drips from his forearm. 

,,Five,'' says William. He balances the cart. ''I feel that we will eighter be travelling with a caravan or alone. I only hope I travel with a pack and friend who I have journeried across the caves and plains.''

Spear stares forward. 

Kirra says, ,,We go as one.'' He grabs Spear bleeding scratch with hand and grips. 

Spear and Kirra stare.

,,One,'' says Kirra. She release hand from Spear and walks to Guile.

Guile smirks and squeeks a laughter and sniffs with nose following the scent of blood on Kirra's hand. He steps back as Kirra steps around the cart and between the cart and two oxgoblins stomping ot a stop behind.

Kirra steps to Guile and grabs Guile's wrist as he tries to back aways.

,,Kirra,'' says Myst then hums.

The hum sooths over the skin. 

''Kirra, we must remain in Tune and calm if we are to find our voice to sing as a choir and not battle solists.''

,,TUNE!'' says a person covere with colored sheets and glasses. The person raises an had. ''Tune.'' They hum and step from between an oxgoblins and glass wagon toward Spear.

Spear steps and stands before the person, peers down.

Myst says, ,,It a song of Tune you wish to hear I can only caste the sounds given to me by Rieghn, but unlike my friends Tune and Reighn sing as one through the realms of our beings.''

,,Tune, controlls my song,'' says the being before spear. ''I...''

Kirra pull short sword from scabbard.

William holds cart with one hand.

Spear breathes down

Guile laughs a squeek.

The being covered in wrapped color sheet and dark glasses stands and steps back. ''I thought...''

Myst steps before Kirra and hums and says, ,,Come sing with me if you be a mind who finds the timing in the music of tune.''

The being steps back.

An oxgoblin blusters and shits.

Two more being covered in robes and towels wrapped around head step twoard ther other.

,,I...'' says the being.

,,I am Myst of Reighn,'' says Myst.

She walks slow and calm by William, next to Spear and before the other.

,,Glik Hk,'' says Glik Hk. ''I am a follow of Tune. Prayers of song sing from my mouth through the winds of the desert.''

Myst hums, ,,Glik Hk, I hope forgiveness for the discourse of our meeting, but our group can not find our beat.''

,,Yeah, you need a beat for a group,'' says Glik Hk.

The two other dressed and glasses wearing being stand nod. 

Glick Hk says, ,,We sing.''

,,Where are we?'' says William.

,,Where?'' says Glik. ''Gnomsidy getting ready to leave with the caravan.''
