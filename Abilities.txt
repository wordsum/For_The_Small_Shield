Spear, Guide and  Flare stand outside of wooden building built around a tree and strung and hung together with rope.

A platfrom with a cauldron and a rock pit for fire spans before Spear, Guide and  Flare. The platform spans around the huge tree trunk a third its height from the tried swamp. The cauldron and rock pit blows smoke.

Hobgoblins and hugoblins sit around rock fire pit. They wittle sticks and chucks of wood into bolts and arrows and spears. They smeld iron tips in cauldron to make metal tips for the arrow, bolts and spears.

A stack of spears and arrows and bolts lay under a tarp.

Spear sees the covered missles. He watches hugoblins pass.

He sees a hugoblins by stone fire bit grip spear and peer as two soldiers marks around the parameter of the ring platform.

The soldiers step past Flare and Guide.

Flare and Guide stand near Spear and peer at the passing soldiers, the people and the collective. The feel a calm focus from Spear and hear the clicks and clack. 

The two soldiers walk by Kirra and Jan. 

Jan grips her staff and leans on branch and woven rope to peer between the strands to the puddle and ponds below.

Dead grass and moss lay in piles around tubes to pumps. Long boards lay end over end. 

A group of six soldiers carry rolls of tube over shoulders and step along the wooden boards.

Kirra says, ,,We can remain. Bring water to the swamp.''

Jan stares. 

Spear glances at Jan and Kirra as they stand at the edge of sight as the platform turn the corner of the buliding and tree. Spear stands and feels a sense of danger. Spear watches the group of goblinsking making spears, arrows and bolts.

The groups stares at Flare then the soldiers. Their talk is silent. The whittle of their spears and bolts speak.

,,Flare,'' says Spear. ''Walk around. Watch the land.''

Flare stares at Spear. He feels the strenght and calm from Spear. He nods and walks away.

The stares of the siting hobgoblins and hugoblins watch Flare walk to a rope bridge and away then return to whittling.

Spear nods and stand and walks and stomps the cold peering into the darkness as he walks.

Through the darkness candles flicker and sway, sihlouettes move over sheets, smoke wiffs, the sound of William's voice fills the halls.

Spear hears it as a light whisper.

william, inside the room, says, ,,What abilities?'' He looks at KlackClock. ''Why?''

The pack stands and looks at KlackClock and GitThutFlikUmtStah.

GitThutFlikUmtStah laughs from deep below like Spear. He laughs and says with fluent surface talk, ,,Not your abilitie to lie.'' GitThutFlikUmtStah sits in a wooden chair with posture. She looks at Shake. ''Your story is good for the soldier fools. All are paraniod and frighten of the queen. The ruler. The oracle.''

Shake pops wrist and lets dagger slide into hand and says, ,,I'm a good bard. Not a great bard.''

Myst smirks. ,,It's not like he's Carlos the Barded Dwarf.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah chuckles. ,,No. No Shake the Bard is no Carlos the Barded Dwarf.'' 

,,I am not,'' says Shake. ''But I have abilities.'' He smiles. ''Many better than-''

William inturrupts. ,,Our abilities are our own.'' He steps back and grips gauntlet, puts hand on hilt. ''

KlackClock says, ,,Friends.'' He spread arms. ''Friends. We save.''

,,We saved you from the soldiers doubt that would become mistrust.'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah. She stands. I need a walk to see how deep your lie.'' 

William says, ,,If you needed time to know the truth of our lives then you should know our abilities.''

,,William,''' says Myst. ''Please for the Song of Reighn to allow the sounds of fate to be.''

Guile says, ,,I have an abilitiy to eat.'' He peers through the Robe of Reighn hood. He stares at GitThutFlikUmtStah and lets an mental shout.

William grabs hilt. ,,What are your abilities?''

GitThutFlikUmtStah snarles, stands and slams fist on table. ,,Many.''

Guile's mental shout returns an echo of thought. Guile focuse on the thought then spans the scope like a maze tracing a relief creating a picture of GitThutFlikUmtStah emotions.

The fist slam of GitThutFlikUmtStah pounds through the hall to Spear.

Spear pauses and looks at Guide. ,,Alarm if soldiers approach.'' He walks the dark and the wall to the sound of Minst.

He hears Minst says, ,,I have an ability to sleep.'' He sits and holds back a yawn holding arm close to chest.

Spear stand outside the room hidding in the darkness.

Inside the room Guile says, ,,Where's the food.''

KlackClock stands, nods and walks to the wall. He steps to the hall of darkness and dim candle light and passes Spear with out pause.

The sheet slides closes.

GitThutFlikUmtStah sighs. He slouches in chair. Her hands lays forarms on table. ,,The soldiers came seasons past.'' She looks at William catching a flicker of candle light. ''At first we thought good things to come. WE believed with an organized goblin force we could live beyond this swamp. The soldiers then began to consume food, take homes. Then more and more arrived. The machines destroyed many of the routes. Instead of trade and entertianment and farming to keep out city alive. The soldiers left as soon as they arrived leaving a few hold fort and command. Then befoe the snow season an army of soldiers arrived with their pumps and machines from that Gnome City in the desert.'' She pause. ''They damed and drained the swamp. They killed our farms.''

,,Farms,'' says Minst. He yawns and leans back on the blush pillows and says with eyes closed. ''What did you farm?''

,,The grass you see weaves and dries to buckets.'' She lifts hands. ''The fish and the eels. ...We make speaks. Hunting weapons. Then they drain the swamp.''

,,Then they drained the swamp because of the black dragon,'' says Shake.

,,They drained the swamp to divert the water for other town.'' GitThutFlikUmtStah looks at Shake. ''The swamp along the raod were drained because of the black dragon.
''

,,How long has the black dragon been attacking the swamp city?'' says William.

Minst snores.

GitThutFlikUmtStah looks at William. ,,Sit. We will talk. We will eat. You will sleep. You will leave or help.''

William nods and sits.

Guile draws a colored relief of a star of Reighn. His psychic string snaps with a glance at Myst and GitThutFlikUmtStah.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,We were meeting freinds in the building that feel. In the building you sleeping friend save long enough to save our friends.''

Guild stands abrupt and stumbles to a bad and lays down. 

William says while watching Guile. ,,Has that dragon attacked before the Rise that shined this new Cycle?''

,,Yes,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah. ''Many times. Many Cycles. Many lives. Still the soldiers do nothing, but react and drain all the water of the swamp.''

Shake twitches and feels the buzz of speed. ,,Are there any dwarves in this town?''

,,Dwarves?'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah. ''There may be. The town is a city.'' She lets her voice fade. ''Now it is a fort, a station for war. Wait awhile and you will see the war machines roll along.

,,Has Carlos the Barded Dwarf been here?'' says Shake.

GitThutFlikUmtStah somber voice become near cheerful. ,,No.''  She stands. ,,There is a rope ladder under the pillows that will lead to the swamp bottome. There is a hatch above the pillows. Food will be brought. Eat. Sleep. We will talk.'' She steps and nods at William, Spear and walks the hall to the light and the Rise and between the trees. 

Guide watches GitThutFlikUmtStah clack and click to the gobinkin around the fire. She lowers and looks at the smoldering coals the blows, points and click and clacks as she walks away to the rope bridge that the walked to find. 

Spear steps behind Guide. ,,Follow without sight.''

Guide steps to the rope bridge and walks without moving the bridge...

Kirra sees Guide follow GitThutFlikUmtStah then Spear.

Spear steps along the curve to Kirra. ,,My sense tells me we found kindred people.''

,,You don't trust your sense,'' says Kirra. 

Spear looks over the swamp land. ,,I don't trust goblins.''

Kirra smirks, huffs. ,,I don't trust humans.''

Spear smiles. ,,I don't trust humans.''

Kirra shoulders relax. Her hand falls from the hilt of short sword to her side.  ,,We leave.''

,,We sleep, eat. Leave. Inside there was talk about help.'' Spear steps and leans against the rope wall and sinks like a hammack. ''They say they are farmers.'' He looks at Kirra. ''They know our story is a lie.''

,,Where is you other follower, Shaman Spear?'' says Jan. 

Spear looks at the goblinkin around the stone firepit. ,,Gone. I sensed the distruct from the goblinkin sitting around the fire. Told him to secure area.'' He looks at Kirra. ''You say you leave.''

Kirra looks at two soldiers walking along a rope bridge above heads. ,,Save the land and not the kingdom.''

Spear says, ,,I am beginning believe they are the same.''

Jan watches the soldiers below.

The soldiers below attach a tube to the end of a tube then put the tube end into a pools of water. The six soldiers walk along the boards to a dome box with a lever pivoting in middle. Three soldiers stand by the ends of the lever. On set of three pushes their end of lever up while other set of three pulls their end of lever down.

Four more hugoblins soldiers wearing black chain maile, red hide walk along boards with shord swords and shield held. Two more soldiers walk along rope bridge hanging from other trees. Two soldiers walk along the rope bridge that lead the pack to their current spot.

The two soldiers stand near Spear, Kirra and Jan. They peer over the cauldron and the fire pit into the darkness of the building hall.

In the building, Shake, William, Minst, Myst and Guile stand, sit or sleep.

As Spear leaves to talk with Kirra, Shake steps to the pile of pillow and throws them aside revealing a rope ladder. ,,The ladder.'' The buzz of speed through Shake calms and times slows. Shake grabs his pocket and squeeze the vial if Speed. ''Help lift for roof and find the other exit,'' says Shake as he steps to William.

William kneels and waves fingers of guantlet and hand.

Shake steps on guantlet and hand. William lifts, stands. Shake grabs ropes, reaches to the edge and lift up on a hemp canvas.

A flap folds back to a rope ladder along the trunk between the branches to a thick branch and two ropes above the thick branch. 

The branch and two rope lead to branch tips and a rope. 

,,What do you see, Shake,'' says William.

Shake drops to floor. ,,There's a rope.'' He looks at William and smiles. ''And it's Speed.'' He winks.

,,Speed,'' says William. 

Guile opens Robe of Reighn. 

A fume of sweat and taint plums. 

Minst coughs in sleep, and Myst sings and opens eyes looking at Guile.

,,Can we trust these goblins?'' says Guile.

,,No,'' says Shake.

,,We have no reason not trust these people,'' says Myst.

,,People,'' says William he looks at Shake. ''These are people. And trust.'' He pauses. ''No. But we should let them create trust.''

Myst stops her soft song and looks at William to hear him speak after the pause.

Minst sleeps, and Myst sits and sings

Shake peers is that Guide.

Guide stands in the dark hall. He hides in the deep shadows and stares at the soldiers.

The soldiers step and look at the spears and the cauldron. The soldiers click and clack with the people around the fire.a

Flare stands on a tree away on a rope walk through the branches. He grabs blow gun a dart. 

The soldiers and fishers and smiths work on bolts and spears. 

A soldier slaps a worker tieing a net. They click and clack. The worker ducks head and the raised fist of the soldier.

Spear peers at the soldiers.

Kirra looks at Spear and holds her dagger. 

Spear's jaw clenches.

Jan watches the soldiers below pump water. She feels a low tone and a flat moan that pulls the emotion from body. 

Spear stares. 

Flare and Guide feels Spear's attack tension. 

Guide says like the wind blow into the room. ,,There are two soldiers talking to the workers. I feel Spear's attack.''

William grabs sword hilt. 

Shake steps and looks through the dark hall. He sees the soldiers point toward the dark hall then the cauldren. 

The soldiers point and click loud. One walks to the spear pile and slams the spear shaft against the stone. 

A loud thunk is heard by all. 

Soldiers below that Jan stares upon look up. 

Flare raises blow gun to mouth and drips the dart. Flare aims the blow gun at the neck of the solider hitting spear against the stone.

The spear doesn't break.

The soldier raises the spear above head an howls a growl. 

Each of the soldier grab a spear and walk over the rope bridge. One soldiers stope and peers and at Spear, Kirra and Jan. It points metal spear tip at the trio, says with slow surface talk. ,,Hu-ma-ns.'' It clacks a laugh and walks on. 

,,The soldiers are leaving,'' says Shake. 

,,Guide, how's Spear feel,'' says William.

Guide says, ,,Shaman feels calm.''

..Food,'' says Guile. He lays head on table.

William walks and lifts char and rest it aaginst the trunk. He unstraps pack and lets it fall. He pulls sword from sits, and his armor shifts and rubs against the cut shoulder. ,,Food may come. Food will go. Sitting a chair should always be charished.''

Shake and Guile looks through the shadows to the space outside.

Shake says, ,,You write that?''

,,I said that,'' says William. He shifts in seat. His long sword strikes the guitar, and the  guitar string plucks.

The string plucks the soft song in Myst's mind to discord to a quick symphony that cresendos then settles soft in Myst's mind.

Myst's eyes open. ,,The guitar of Reighn seen.''

William looks down and grabs the guitar lifting it to the rays of light and some dim candle light.

The guitar's base is stain with acid spots. One string is tied from base, over bridge to end of neck. The bridge is bent. The neck crackd.

Shake leans from the door toward the guitar. ,,That think won't be playing.''

William tosess the guitar on the table. ,,Rubbish.''

The sound of the guitar hitting table and William's words discord Mysts of hum to a studder. The word, ,,Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish,'' spoke with the clatter of the guitar in Myst's mind.

,,Keep it. Hold it,'' says Myst. She stops her hum and stares at William. ''Please. There is song left in the broken guitar.''

Wiliam hears the repeat of the word rubbish with the song of the guitar clutter. He hears the song of Reighn from Myst. ,,Yes. I will, Myst.''

Myst looks away. 

Guile says, ,,Hungry.''

Shake looks through the hall and says, ,,How's Shaman Spear feel now?''

Guild says, ,,The Shaman in to casting his senses.''

Spear, the Shaman, casts a gance at Flare as Flare lowers the blow gun. ,,I could heat the mud from the swamp bottom.''

,,There is nurishment in the mir,'' says Jan.

Kirra pushes from the ropes. She stands and rolls and hold the hilt of dagger with hand so the blade is parallel with forearm. ,,Goblins.''

Jan looks through the ropes at the soldiers. ,,Chewy. Stringy muscle.'' Jan looks at Spear and Kirra. ''Never ate hobgobins, hugobloin.'' 

The tries stands on the circular platform and watch in silence. Then Kirra says, ,,Why you journey?''

Spear stares at soldiers walking above and below. ,,It feels the way. It leads to hold the flood.'' Spear side looks at Kirra then Jan. ''Your path remain?''

Kirra stands. 
 
Jan says, ,,We remain. We follow the destiny.'' She looks away from the pumps pumping water from the pond at the bottom of the empty swamp. ''Break damns when can.''

Spear looks away from staring at Jan's naked body clothed only in mud stain. ,,Cold.''

Jan Hfompf says, ,,No.'' She stares. ''I feel nothing but low vibrating tones and death.''

Spear stares with Jan then steps from Kirra and Jan. ,,I will warm my hand by the fire.'' He sits by the fire. 

The pack sits and picks at packs and tears. The looks at the pocks and cut and burises. Bones hurt.

As Guile begins to take off his wood braces, Shake says, ,,I see the KlackClock or was it...I see food.''

Guile lifts head. ,,Food.''

,,Food,'' says Shake. 

KlackClock carries a sack, a basket of bread and casket over the rope bridge, by Spear and into the darkness of the hall to the room.

Shake steps back and behind KlackClock.

,,Food,'' says KlackClock. 

A basket with bread spill over the table. The sack and caste hit table with a thump.

KlackClock stands and steps back. ,,Eat. Sleep. Near rise I return. Talk. Talk abilities.'' KlackClock looks at William and Shake and steps back. He half bows, half nods and full stumbles to the all to quick walk to the day light. 

,,Guide, please let Spear know there is food,'' says William as he opens the sack the size of Spear torso.

Spear looks at Guide.

Guide steps into the room. ,,Shamn knows. I will take the Shaman food.''

,,A servant,'' says Shake. ''I need to become a barbarian. Get people to server me.''

William grunts and pulls apart a knot in the rope tieing the sack. ,,Yes...Would...Be nice.''

The sack opens.

Dirt, musk, mold fumes flow from sack. 

William gags. Shake covers nose. Guile coughs. Myst stops singing to cover face. Minst coughs and rolls over to cover face then rolls on other side when pain pokes arm, shoulder.

,,A trap,'' gasps Shake.

,,Food,'' says Guide. ''Root and swamp weed.'' He reaches inside and pulls long strang of grass fuming like vinager and mold. Guide smiles. ,,Smell bad.'' He open mouth wide and bends head back and dangles swamp weed over mouth.

The swamp weed drips fumes. 

Fume plum.

Guile covers mouth and nose. Stomach convuleses.

Guides lowers the swamp weed into mouth chewing and licking the fuming juices for swamp weed from mouth.

Guile pushes the open end of the bag of root and swamp weed. His stomach convules. He swallows pile and runs from the room, bumps into Spear, the hall to the fire and the morning light shining beams.

Lke, Guile, The root and swamp weed fumes flow from the room through the hall and to Spear, Kirra and Jan.

Spear smells and crinches as he peers through the darkness and glances at all around.

Jan inhales, smiles. ,,Root and swamp weed.''

Kirra smirks, ,,Swamp weed.''

Jan looks at KIrra. 

Kirra steps and nods. She walk by Guile as Guile sits by the fire, covers hood and breathes. She walks halls steps and slide by, Guide, Spear and table. She grabs sack of root and swamp weed from Spear's reach. She grabs a fist full and steps sees William and Shake and Myst looking at the bag and Guide eating the swamp weed. Kirra says, ,,The brown tubes sweetest.''

Spear bites a long brown tube as thick as fingers. He chews. 

,,It's smells,'' says Shake.

Kirra says, ,,Don't smell,'' steps from room with root and swamp weed. 

Drops of root and swamp weed splash on boards past the fire and near Giule.

Guile convules.

The people around the fire click and clack a laugh then a rhythm of sounds. The chatter of clicks and clacks finds a pattern of space and marks.

Guile countes and traces the sounds in a group of individuals. He sees the sounds scratch along a space of marks and scribbles.

The fumes of the root and swamp weed fume.

Guile thinks of sounds and marks.

Kirra thinks of food.

Jan smells the root weed dirt fumes with mint clouding by the vinigar and moss fumes of swamp weed.

Board creak as Kirra steps and holds her hand before Jan.

Jan grabs a bunch and pulls them from Kirra's mess of roots hanging from hand. She bites and chews tasting the mint and vingar and root base make a sweet treat.

Sugars rush through tongue through blood and gives a buzz and rush through Jan, Spear and Guide.

Kirra pulls one swamp root and dangles it over open mouth. She lowers the grass like root into mouth chewing it's mess, soft skin.

Jan and Kirra chew.

Kirra says, ,,Cooked good.''

Jan swallows and says, ,,Better without cooking.''

Inside the room fuming with mint and vinegar, moss and dirt, Spear chews and tastes all the flavors the flush to a rush of a buzz. The hunger burn sooths. ,,Food.''

Shake grabs a loafs of bread from the basket and leaves the room.

,,Eat,'' chews and says Spear.

William puts hand in sack and pulls out a pinch of grass.

Guide says while chewing. ,,Eat the tubes. Taste good. Juices.''

William takes a brown tube of the root weed and eats.

A zing spreads from mouth and the mint clears his nose.

William nods and chews.

Myst watches. She grabs bread. She eats bread.

Shake carries bread from room, hall to Guile. He holds the bread before Guile.

Guile stares at the fire listening to the clicks and clacks of hte people. The click and clacks form group marks. The marks find pattern and create words patterns.

Shake sets the bread on Guile's lap, sits and nipples on bread.

The pack eats.

Then Guile slumps and sleeps with thought of marks and calls.       

Shake watches Guile's head fall and nod. Shake watches Kirra and Jan. 

Jan stares to the swamp below and watch goblinking wearing hide armor and swooping sickles at the long strans of grass laying over the mud floor. She watches the walk ways.

Kirra leans to the rope wall and sleeps with one hand on hilt of dagger and one arm wove through the rope weave and hand grabbing rope.

Then Kirra wakes and watches while Jan sleeps.

Shake watches Kirra, Jan, Guile and the goblin people around the fire. He taps his foot.

The goblin people whittle, sand, shape and caste spears, bolts and arrows. They stand and walk. One smokes a pipe. They stand and walk inside during the times of the morning and zenith the the Set.

Inside the room of hide sheet and rope, Spear sits, eats sleeps and pulls his bastard sword from his scabbard then cleans the blade with a pillow case as he sleeps.

Myst and William eat in silence. Each make faces for the other. They both stare. They both look away after a many blinks held away.

They eat and stare.

William says, ,,I will remain awake.''

Myst smiles. ,,We sleep. Reighn's song will give us warning of danger or evil.''

william looks at Myst. ,,Then I will sleep.'' He grabs his broken and burn guitar and sits in chair. He pucks the guitar to sleep with long sword near side.

The sun nears set.

The cool become cold.

Shake watches soldiers, farmers, workers retie rope of a walkway three trees away. Things over and over bits of lyrics that form words. ,,Through the swamp and trolls we fight...Though. ...Through the swamp we fun...Through...Trolls. Rolls...Mud. Swamp. Drained...'' He mummbles and talks and looks and watches and peers through the dark hall to the room.

In the room, Minst wakes.

A stale cloud of mint and moss vinegar fumes.

Minst plugs nose. He puts hand between folds of armor to touch spine of spell book and touches only foldes of Elven Chain Mail.

Pillows are thrown, a chari moved.

Minst's spell book lays on floor.

William shuffles in sleeps. Spear's snore stops. Guide sleeps and stands still. A soft song flows from Myst's snores as she rolls over the pillow to the space where Minst lay.

Minst stands and grabs component back and goblin spell book, his spell book and a loaf of bread before walk to the smoking fire pit.

A cool blow through Minst's Elven Chain Mail and the Undergarment of Kirra. ,,A cold night comes.''

Shake shakes and looks up from mumble. ,,Yes. it will be colder than day.'' His stare gets lost. He scratches wrist and wipe forehead of sweat. ''Colder than day, but no loder than I remain. Remain. ...A damned swamp.'' Shake looks at Minst as Minst sits. ''A dammed swamp. That's it that's...'' He looks at Guile then the lone goblins sitting by the fire. 

The goblins sits and stares at the coals cool to  dim read.

Minst bites his bread with a crunch of crust. Flakes of bread sprinkle over Minst. Arm in noose falls and pulls pain through it then body.

,,An unknown road through damned swamp. The only road through a damned swamp we go,'' says Shake. ''Through the damned swamp we mopped the mud with our boots...And out...Out...'' Shake looks at Minst.

Minst opens his spell book in a ray of setting light. ,,I like.'' He looks at Shake and turns a page. ''Do you have your song?''

,,No,'' says Shake. ''No song. Lyrics. Thoughts.'' He twitches the itches cheek. ''But no song.''

Minst softly nods and looks at spell book and reads. 

Shake mumbles. Minst reads.

The sun lowers. Rays of low fade to dim. 

A cool breeze blows to a cold wind. 

Shake says, ,,Is it hard?''

Minst reads.

Shake moves closer to Shake and looks at Minst's spell book. ,,Is that hard...Difficult to read.''

Minst glances. ,,Yes. It's...'' The reliefs and shapes flux and bend.

,,Why is it difficult?'' Shake leans over Minst. ''I learned the cantrip of the making a fire...A flame...From thumb. Hern showed me.'' Shake reaches for the fire and grabs some coal and puts it in pocket.

Minst reads the shapes flowing and creating a flash of fire. The fires expands through his mind burning the shapes and reliefs to a smoke cloud in the mind. 

Shake mumbles. ,,What if they want us all here to then kill us in one spot. With one swoop and easy. They could do it. They would.

Then Shake hears a baby cry from the sheet building. He looks from the coals of the fire. 

Candle light castse flame of kids and mom.

''A lie,'' mummbles Shake to thought.

The sun lowers.

Then KlackClock was around the bridge, past Kirra and Jan, who both sleep standing. KlackClock was by the stone fire pit and calduern.

KIrra wakes from mediation and grabs dagger.

Shake says, ,,YOu return.'' He looks at KlackClock. 

KlackClock waves hand and arm. ,,Come.''

Shake follows. Kirra wanders and watches. Minst reads and Jan sleeps like a tree.

KlackClock leads through the darkness as Shake stomps behind.

The stomps wake Spear, Guide and William. 

,,Myst,'' says William. ''Myst!''

Myst sleeps moaning and snoring a song. 

ClackKlick steps to the door. ,,It I.''

Kirra steps behind and Shake beside. 

Shake says, ,,What if got spell to explode?''

Jan wakes and steps and touches the shoulders of Guile.

Guile hunges and sleeps. Guile hears the internal talk of the hugoblin named Hu Glick Hick Thack. The clicks and clacks a song for Guiles dreaming mind following the talk and the worroies of the harvest to no eel or swamp turtle to eat after spring birthing.

Jan leans and speaks into Guile's hood. ,,Guile.''

Guiles startles and shakes awake and kicks the bread on his robe to the ground. He stands and stumbles and falls.

,,It's Jan,'' says Jan.

Hu Glick Hick Thack leans back and looks at Guile. 

Guile looks at Hu Glick Hick Thack, Jan, the bread. He picks up the bread and says, ,,Jan.'' Peer peer at her eyes. ''Jan.'' He looks around blinking away the image and talk of Hu Glick Hick Thack. ''Where is Kirra? Shake?''

With perfect tone she says with click and clack talk, ,,Klack Clock Tlik OKla.''

Guile squints and looks down the dark hall. ,,Into the...''

Jan nods.

Through the dim dark of the hall to Shake, Minst, Kirra

Shake wispers for only Kirra to hear. ,,What if ClackKlack is leading us to a trap here or there?''

Kirra says without whisper, ,,Enough soldiers to attack. We have a common foe. If we die then or now we die then or now.''

Minst stumble of the click and clacks while saying, ,,Klack Clock is here.''

KlackClock steps to door. ,,We go. GitThutFlikUmtStah waits.''

,,Why?'' say Shake. He nudges by Kirra. He grabs his dagger. He shakes.

KlackClock says, ,,The soldiers watch.''

The words spread a calm feeling to Spear. A glow wells then spreads.

Kirra nods.

William stands and stretches. He sheaths his long sword and grabs his guitar whose neck seems less bowed. ,,We go,'' says William.

Guide, Myst, Spear stand.

KlackClock stands and turns, looks and poinst at Minst, Kirra, Shake then points at Hu Glick Hick Thack. ,,Go sit with Hu Glick Hick Thack.'' He points at William, Myst, Spear, Guide. ''With me. We meet.''

,,Trying to split us up,'' says Shake.

KlackClock looks at Shake. ,,No..''

,,To hide number, Shake.'' William glares at KlackClock. He grips his fists and guantlet.

KlackClock clack and snaps a sound. 

The sound snaps again from the wall behind Minst. 

Boards creak and a hugoblins steps from a cloth door. 

Shake jumps and poinsts knife

Kirra guides Shake's arm amd grabs it.

The hugoblin walks from the darkness of the hall to the dim of the dusk, picks a bundle of arrows and bolts.

Another hugoblins walks from another room with cross bows, short bows, daggers and darts bundled in arms, stops by Kirra and stares at her.

Kirra push Shake against the wall.

The hugblins passes with the weapons bundle, walks by Spear and lays the weapons on table.

KlackClock points at the table. ,,Abilities.'' He puts the weapon side the bag of root and swamp weed.

The hugoblin returns with the bolts, arrows and spear. The bolts and arrows are put into a pillow case.

KlackClock grabs spear bundle and holds out one. ,,Take one.''

The pack in the hide and rope room and hall takes a spears.

,,We go,'' says KlackClock.

William nods.

,,To our death,'' says Shake.

,,Go,'' says Kirra. 

Spear steps. ,,Go.'' 

The half pack follows KlackClock. 

KlackClock clicks and clacks past Hu Glick Hick Thack, who clicks and clacks. 

Guile grabs bread and stands and walks. 

,,Remain, Guile,'' says William.

,,We go other way,'' says Kirra.

The pack parts with the part following Hu Glick Hick Thack and KlackClock over rope bridges, walkways, tree branch paths to platforms where they climbed up ropes and down ropes. 

KlackClock arrives at the same time Hu Glick Hick Thack along two seperate rope bridges leanding to a branch. 

The branch spans like a sidwalk into the tree and through the branch like the bottom of a hall. 

The pack stands with KlackClock and Hu Glick Hick Thack.

Last rays of sun light radiate and red light along the top of the distand mountains.

Clouds float from the Rise. 

Shadows flow into the branch. Dim lights glow away the shadows and nights leading the pack down the walk way into the trees.

Through the branches and light, Spear and Kirra see sihlouettes standing with crossbow and blow gun. 

Kirra and Spear glance and nod at each other. Then each stares in the eyes of William, Guide, Myst and nod at the sihlouettes through the dark of the branches follow their path deeper to trunk.

Shake grips his spear. ,,Any of these shades move and I kill.'' He grips pocket with vial of speed. 

,,I want light to see,'' say William. 

Light shines through the branch and leads to a distant wall of rope, hide and hemp walls. The sihlouttes in the dust become dark from the shine.

Myst's quiet mind strikes a cord, and her finger taps the drum.

Blow gun and bows are raised and aimed. 

The sounds fades to silence.

William peers through the light only sees darkness, says, ,,If arrow or dart strikes the pack our rage will not be silenced.''

KlackClock and Hu Glick Hick Thack lead along the wooden blanket pather over the wide tree trunk. They click and clack.

Click and clacks come from the lights. 

The hemp door rolls up from path. 

Darkness is beyond the door.

GitThutFlikUmtStah's voice speaks from the darkness. ,,Enter please. Single file. Walk forward. After tens steps you may step to side.'' The voice talks through clicks and clacks that settle. Silence spreads through the darkness.

William leads into the darkness behind KlackClock and Hu Glick Hick Thack. Ten steps the pack walks into a square.

,,It's the size of the inside of a Waterdown Opera house,'' says Shake.

The darkness creates four walls and ceiling. 

Hugoblins and hobgoblins stand wearing thick hide stained. All hold spears and stakes. 

,,Thrity-four,'' says Minst. He points. ''And look at the shelves.

Shelves and basket float along the dark lifting an holding books, jars and scrolls. 

Dim light glow.

''Where are the branches?'' says Minst.

Jan feels a hollow energy filler then spread from her. 

The tree's force fills her with life and its deep vibrations tone through her.

Guide says to Spear. ,,I feel the presense of Blue.''

,,I feel Blue,'' says Jan.

,,Blue is with these people,'' says Guide.

Spear nods. He looks at Guide. He feels a glow of a force holding Guile to himself. ,,And these are farmer warriors.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,The branches were trained to grow around the space to make the room.''

Shake hears Jan and Guide and Spear. He says loud after GitThutFlikUmtStah speaks. ,,What do you know of Blue, GitThutFlikUmtStah.'' Shake says GitThutFlikUmtStah with the clicks and sutble accent of goblin spoken the swamp region. 

The talks with surface tongue and goblins tongue yaps and clicks and clacks to silence.

Heads turn and look at the pack. A few of farm warriors step back.

William stand and stares at GitThutFlikUmtStah.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,Blue.''

Jan clicks, ,,Thlick.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah stares.

The farmer-warriors look at the pack. More of them step back. 

GitThutFlikUmtStah looks at the farmer-warriors and steps to William. ,,Thlick. Blue, has helped us fight more than you. Blue knew Yellow and made Green now that Yellow is dead from what we call the desert Queen Blue is calling to nature the lands beings.''

The pack relax, and Shake stares and says, ,,I wasn't expecting that reason.'' Shake looks at Spear and back at Guile then looks at GitThutFlikUmtStah. ''GitThutFlikUmtStah, I did not believe your reply would be truth and story.'' He peers, ''But I know nothing of Blue, so you could telling a lie.''

Jan feels the Blue and the void and engry pulling her away. ,,Blue,'' she says.

Guile knows and says, ,,Blue is with us.''

Spear believes. ,,Blue will yeild.''

William grips guantlet. ,,We don't fight for Blue.''

,,You wear Blue's armor,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah.

,,Abilities,'' says KlackClock. ''Not Blue. Your abilities.''

,,I will not lead with or fight without my pack.'' William steps. ''How do we know your alighnment and mission for our abilities will not create chaos and evil.''

Shakes says fast and loud, ,,What we get out of helping you!''

GitThutFlikUmtStah nods. The farmer-warriors look at the pack. ,,We give you guide for passage for your travels. We give you the honor of helping fight against the goblins warriors who only wish to kill spread their army.''

Kirra says, ,,I will not help Blue.''

Jan grabs Kirra's hand and sqeezes. Her voice speaks only for Kirra. ,,Blue's fight is mine.''

Kirra pulls her hand away and glances at Jan.

William says looking around. ,,What do you need of our abilities?''

The quiet room becomes loud with goblinkin Tounge. Farmer-warriors yawn and stretch. Their shoulders slump and backs bend. Fumes mustard, mint and mold fumes of root and swamp weed float.

GitThutFlikUmtStah stands. ,,Our plans to attack a patrol of goblins has been altered with the arrival of you fate, like Blue felt, to now complete a mission that will strike the army!'' She clenches fist. ''For tonight with your abilities we will blow the road from the Rise to the heaven.''

,,Blow,'' says Guile. His muffled voice comes forth from hood. He slowly pulls hood back. ''Blow with powder or magic?''

GitThutFlikUmtStah looks at William. ,,Your abilities are not needed for the blow of road.''

Shake steps between GitThutFlikUmtStah and William  and looks at up, points. ,,We are helping you?''

William says loud as Shake's mouth opens with silence. ,,It's always best to stick with orginial plans. And its foolish to change plans the day of exection of hte mission.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah looks from Shake to William. ,,We offer you passage to the  Rise through this goblin infested lands. We will help you create a far better lie than you have now.'' GitThutFlikUmtStah peers at William. ''How lost are you?''

,,I am never lost while with my pack.'' William steps back and looks at the dark door behind. ''Only a fool would change plans.'' He looks at KlackClock. 'Thank you for shelter and food and calm.'' He lowers head. Then looks at the farmer-warriors. William opens mouth.

Shake says, ,,Thank you for bread. Now off we go to leave you to you war against the mother land.''

William looks at Shake then GitThutFlikUmtStah, ,,Who will guide us where we want to go, and when would we leave? And food. We need food. We need water.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,Flare.''

,,Flare,'' says Shake. Shake smiles. ''The hobgoblin who woreships Spear as a shaman.''

,,Flare will guide,'' GitThutFlikUmtStah steps and clicks and clacks. As GitThutFlikUmtStah speaks, farmer warrors pile waterskins, four sacks of root and swamp weed. ''Take what you need. You will leave after we destroy the road.''

,,Why,'' says William. He stars at GitThutFlikUmtStah. ''How.''

Shake says loud, ,,YOU were helping the trolls.''

The pack looks at Shake.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says and shouts. ,,WARRIORS. We will not need your souls tonight.'' GitThutFlikUmtStah

The farmer warriors raise spears and pitch, forks, sickles. They lower heads and walk from the dark walled room and into the night.

,,Outside I wait,'' says Kirra as she follows the last farmer-warrior from the dark room.

Jan feels to move the body and Kirra steps away. She feels a force hold her feet. A laugh vibrates her being to hear. 

The laughter is heard by Myst, and Myst's Song of Reighn. The strings, drums and hums becomes the laughter. The laughter then fades.

Myst presses her eyes closed and thumps her drum.

The drum hits.

Everyone, but Jan and Myst flich.

The drum bass blows away the laughter.

,,Blue,'' says Myst.

,,Blue,'' says Spear.

Guide feels Spear's rage of Blue. He feels the hate.

William looks at Guide. ,,Why? How? And Blue?''

GitThutFlikUmtStah steps away. ,,The road is leads from Goblin Port. The road is the leads from Goblin Port to the juntion we walked this early shine.''

,,Why?'' says Shake feeling his Speed buzz vibrate against the smooth flow of sight. ''Why blow the road?''

Wiliam kneels and looks around the room. ,,Rope.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah points to a far pile covered with a hemp cover.

William stands and walks the room.

The floating shelves and wooden cabnits are peered over.

,,The dams,'' says William. ''The dams. Once the road needs more protection. The dams will become less guarded.''

,,What about the black dragon?'' says Minst.

William pulls rope bundle and steps quick to the piles and sacks.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,The dragon is searching for the unknown.'' GitThutFlikUmtStah steps and turns and looks at the pack and steps forthe door. ''Go now. Or leave here on your own.

Spear kneels and ties rope around the food bags and water to make a necklace like harnes of food and water.

,,How many,'' says Spear.

,,Three,'' says William.

Spear stands, ,,Who wants to hold the other food bag?''

,,We must meet the other's,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah. His voice is stressed and clicking at end of words.

,,Guide or Kirra,'' says Shake. He stand and ponts at self. ''I need to keep on my toes.'' He points at Minst.  ''Minst's got arm pain.'' He points to Guile. '' Guile can't walk. ''Myst's got that music.''

,,Guide,'' says Spear. ''Carry.''

Guide pulls feet from flow and detach a feeling and a flow of Blue into him. ,,Yes, Shaman,'' says and steps leaving Jan the only one held by something that feels Blue. Then he feels the weight of food and water as he ties the chain.

Blue holds Jan and laughs.

The drum hit from Myst vibrates the laugh to silence then.

Myst's body is relased and feet move and she stumbles to the door and from the room. 

Spear and William watch Jan leave.

William says under breath. ,,Drum scare her away.''

,,Blue,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah.

,,Are you a force of Blue?'' says Minst. 

GitThutFlikUmtStah stands and her body settles. ,,Blue filled the void when Yellow and Green died. Their energy is the same. The force strong. A force that will help the swamp, the land, the balance.''

William ties off rope and steps around pulling on the ties.

Three bags of food are strapped to back with waters shin wrapped around the shoulder and waits straps.

William stands and and shifts and pulls the chain of food and water over neck and shoulders then ties. ,,Why are we need?''

,,Protection,''says GitThutFlikUmtStah. She looks at Minst. ''Can you caste anther ball of fire?''

,,My arm,'' says Minst. ''Movement of arm pains me. It is a pain I do not believe will allow me to caste spells that require the components be caste in patterns.'' He holds arm. He looks from Myst to William and at GitThutFlikUmtStah. 

Myst hums away the laughter of Blue and rubs her hands with the hum of the song of Reighn as GitThutFlikUmtStah nods and walks to the far end of the room and pulls a pack the size of a fist from a floating shelf.

Myst closes her eyes to feel and see the notes play around the room. She feels and follows the notes to place hands around Minst arm. 

A soothing rub and tickles spreads from her hands to Minst arm as Minst hears the song of Reighn in Myst's mind.

The song wraps around the shapes, marks and reliefs etching through Minst's mind as the thought of spells are created from talk of spell. 

Myst's presses on Myst's arm.

Pains silences all but the song the a cool spreads, and Myst sings.

Myst's arm begins to pump with pain then the pain fades as the silences in all minds.

Then a laughter stops thought for the song.

GitThutFlikUmtStah steps and holds forth the first size pouch. ,,The one who blesses find strenght in you soul and prayer and abilities. Blue is everywhere.'' He raises the sack. ''A cream to help the body heal cuts, tears, bruises.''

Minst softly squeezes on arms and looks at Myst, ,,Your song has left the pain gone.''

Myst flicks a smile. ,,My grace of waiting left the pain to long.''

Shake grabs the pack and squeezes.

,,And our abilities.'' Spear steps. ''A wizards spell can be caste while flying in the night sky.''

,,Strenght in fight and order,'' GitThutFlikUmtStah steps to door. ''We must leave. Now.''

Guile feels his stomach drop and hold heave. ,,A pot. I need a pot.'' He stands and parts his Rope of Reighn.

A fume of shit, piss, sweat, brown swamp root blows and flows and fades from smell like a shock. ''A pot.'' Guile feels stone heavey weight down the guts and presses hangs againsts stomach. ''A pot.'' He suffles over the floor to a stacks of pot.

,,A pot,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah. He looks at Shake. ''A pot?''

,,A place to let the body pee and shit,'' says Shake. ''The urge is.''

Guide pulls a pot from a shelf and puts on ground, pulls down pats and poops.

William ties ropes and pulls his war hammer from its hook and lifts it to Spear. ,,Spear. The food, armor and back has me weighted down, my friend.'' The stare. ''If you could carry this Warhammer of the Rose.

Spear smiles, slaps William on shoulders. ,,I will swing the stand and webs off the hammar.'' He grabs the war hammer.

Shake steps to Guile and reaches for a pot.

GitThutFlikUmtStah stand at looks at Guile and Shake.

The pack stands and waits. 

Jan steps out wtih Kirra. 

Kirra stands and watches the farmer-warrriors.

Farmer-warriors walk along the branch path. Each lifts from a stack a bag of root and swamp root.  In singles and pairs the farmer warriors walk from the tree along branch walkways before, above and below. All carry a bag of root and swamp weed.

Jan steps to Kirra. The fuzzy sad feeling spread through her being warms while Jan stands next to Kirra.

Kirra steps away from Jan an long the path until she hears William come from the door of the dark room.

Inside the darkroom, William steps from the pack and leadds with a loud talk, ,,I will be waiting beyond.''

The sound of Shake peeing and Guile grunting out shit gives a twist in Minst thoughts. The spells in mind lose focus and want. The shapes, marks and reliefs fade.  

Minst steps to follow Wiliam. Spear follows Minst, and Myst follow.      

The pack emerges before KIrra, and becomes one after Shake, Guile and GitThutFlikUmtStah emerge from the darkness to the lite trail.

GitThutFlikUmtStah steps past the pack and walk to a rope ladder and climbs. ,,Follow.''

The pack follows up a ladder over a walkways, platforms into the night.. The climb down a trunk to boards along the bottom of swamp between trees and distant lights of goblins around a pump.

GitThutFlikUmtStah leads the pack single file between the trees and talk mound of swamp grass. She steps from the wood trail and walk over a trail of woven grass until that path leads to the side of a steep hill.

All around talking, clicking, laughter and shouts are heard. Lights in the tree tops flicks and shines.

The stomp of boots in rocks is heard above.

Above the steep slope are burn torches illuminating the side of the road and the many bridges and walkwasy that span from the road to the trees.

GitThutFlikUmtStah and the pack walk along a path against the step slop of hemp backs, square stone. 

A few pebbles roll and from above and hit the mir around the mounds of grass.

Torch lights shine over the swamp bottom land illuminating groups of soldiers walking along wooden blanks.

Along the night they walk from and to lights, grass and road until the lights and trees fade and the torches along to road go dark. 

GitThutFlikUmtStah slows and stands. He leaps to a mound of grass and waves Spear, Kirra and the pack to step on the grass and huddle around. With a loud whisper he speaks, ,,We have dug a tunnel beneath the road. Along the trail we will travel we will see out warriors hauling sacks into this hole.''

Shake says loud, ,,What is this?'' He looks through the night. ''What do we need-''

William puts a hand on Shake. ,,Please.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,We have powder bought from the dwarves of the mount. The powder explodes and creates a force that moves dirt, water, trees. We have dug the hole now as of this night we feel that hole with sacks of this powder.'' 

,,And our abilities?'' says William.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,You follow the path past the hole and along the curve of the road.'' She glances into the night. Her voice is lowered. ''Flare will be along the trail by a ladder waiting for you. Follow Flare to the caravan above. Wait and don't let any being or army pass after the signal is given. When the signal is given a fire ball to explode.''

,,This is foolish and insane,'' says Shake. ''Why? Why not use a fuse. Why not blow up. Why-''

,,Quiet,'' says William.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,You outsiders. Your face will be forgot. You will not stop because one of ours may die from the explosion.'' She looks at Shake. ''I trust from actions early you will try to save any who pass. Find away.''

,,How long?'' says Minst. He paces. ''I need to see. I need to see to hit with. And where.'' He talks faster and louders. ''Where. I. this is. I don't understands. Why are we needed. What. What?'' Minst fidges and touches the spin of spell book then touches components on his belt.

Spear squints. ,,Flare will be there.'' 

,,Yes,'' GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ''Follow and help or climb the ladder and leave. Flare will lead to a carvan moving to the Set. It will hide your movement.'' She steps through muck and grass and to the trail along the road bottom. 

William looks back then steps and follows.

The pack walks into the whispers and shadows of the farmer warriors hauling hemp bags the size and shape of the bag holding root and swamp weed. 

The farmer-warriors hold the bag into a tunnel as tall as Shake. Most stand with bags over shoulder while one goblinkin exits. 

GitThutFlikUmtStah raises a hand and two fingers and leads the pack to pass the hole and around the curve of the road. 

Flare stands wearing his soldier armor. He holds a rope ladder as three goblinkin climb down with a sacks over shoulders. Flare steps from the ladder as a hugoblins lands on the grass and dirt path along the road base far below the road top. 

Two farmer warriors step behind Kirra and walks to the ladder and climbs.

GitThutFlikUmtStah talks with Flare and two of the warriors near the ladder. 

Jan hears talk of poweder and escape and soldiers between the flow. 

Guile taps the mind of Flare and feels the click and the clacks and the tension and worry and nervous looks. A calm spreads over GitThutFlikUmtStah and the farmer-warrios who pass as GitThutFlikUmtStah lays a hand on their backs or shoulders, and the farmer-warriors relax and walk on with sack of powder or up the ladder for more. 

Kirra grunts.

William steps to GitThutFlikUmtStah, and their coversation stops as the stare. 

Spear says, ,,If a shaman I be then fate is beyond my understanding.''

,,I feel weird about the situation,'' says Minst.

,,You and me, Minst,'' says Shake. Shake looks at Flare. He points at Flare. ''First, Spear's his shawman. Now he's our gifted guide for helping stand and wait for a fireball to explode. 

Kirra says, ,,Flare missed swing. Warned the pack of soldiers. Our battle hide sounds of coming trolls.''

,,Shawman,'' smiles Spear. ''If I were a shawman. I want nothing of the wizardry and idols.''

<She,> feels Jan and says. ,,She is also a farmer and a giver of Blue.'' 

William says to all with a strong and whisper, ,,Why is she at here watching the ladder when Flare should be by the wagon's fixing what ever is thought to be open.''

GitThutFlikUmtStah nods, ,,Yes.'' 

Flare looks at Spear. 

Spear feels Flare's stare and calm. Spear release her stare. 

Flare nods at Spear and climbs the rope ladder then climbs road side as a sack is slowly lifted by farmer-warrior while the farmer warrior climbs. 

William says, ,,Do you want us by the wagons to scare soldiers?''

,,Yes,'' says GitThutFlikUmtStah.

William says near normal talk. ,,What does Minst need to explode with a fireball?''

GitThutFlikUmtStah squishes through grass and mud. ,,The hole.'' She points.

William says, ,,How long until the ball of fire is cast.''

,,One part of four of a night.''

William steps. ,,Where do you need to be to caste a ball of fire to hit the hole we past.''

Minst touches the spine of his spell book. ,,I need to see the hole.''

,,Can you fly?'' says William. 

,,No.'' Minst says, ''Yes. I could. If I could read. I might have spell components. I might now. I. I don't know.''

William says with normal talk that is low in tone. ,,Shall the pack go to the carvan. Find our positions.''

Shake steps before William. ,,Why? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? We have a map? We have direction? This is?''

William's gauntlet grabs Shake and lifts Shake from ground to the face of William.

William says, ,,Quiet or I will gag you.'' He drops Shake as he peers at Shake.

,,He's on Speed,'' says Guile.

William grabs his pocket of Blue Armor. ,,When did you steal it from me?''

,,It fell out of you pocket during the battle,'' says Shake casting smeer at Guile.

Guile sees through is gray sight. ,,Shake took the Speed before the dragon battle.''

,,William,'' say Spear. ''Climb the ladder.''

Myst leans and whispers sweet notes by William's ear. ,,William calm you should be for a friend before you is what you see.'' She blows on William's ear.

William's heart beat slows and the force of rage sooths. William's Guantlet covered hand drops Shake.

Shake stumble and hits back against the wall. ,,I was nervous about the battle I was scarred. I was frightened.'' Shake bottom lip begins to quiver, eyes swell. Through night sight and sound all see Shake near tears. He grabs the ladder and climbs.

William stares and sees Shake, exhales, grabs ladder and climbs.

A hugoblins carrying a sack toward the ladder hits Spear's arm.

Spear holds the hugoblins back from the ladder. ,,My friend prone to fall.'' Spear looks at the hugoblins. ''Wait until he reaches the top.''

A dull thunk echoes and spans from above.

Spear raises hands to mouth.

GitThutFlikUmtStah says, ,,The workers fixing broke wagon.''

William looks down.

Spear wave to top.

William and Shake climb to the top. The pack follows.

A row of covered walled wagons create a row that flickers through the night. One wagon is uncovered. It's wheel and axle broken. Bags of root and swamp weed are stacked in two piles. One hugoblin whittles away at a wagon well spoke, while another pulls to fit a metal rim around the wooden wheel. A third hits U nail over iron rod and into wood beam that supports the bottom of the wagon. The beam is cracked in the center.

The wagons are hitched to breast that look like an ox and a goblin. The black green skin glows with a shines in the torch light. Puffs of cold blow from snott covered nostrels. Scalls and small shell covered top of head and neck. Hairless tails slither like snakes over the ground.

Shake stares at one of the beasts near.

William steps behind Shake.

They stand between the wagons and the edge of the road. The wagons are parked three wide steps from road's edge.

The road's edge span the width of two mature giant oak trees.

Torches and a few floating globes glow over groups of farmers around bots a couple fires.

Spear, Kirra, Jan, Flare, Myst, Minst, Guide and Guile climb to top. 

Guile breathes heavy. He stands by Shake, who streas at the ox-goblins beast. ,,It's ugly.''

A few heads turn from the three farmers and smith working on wagon. 

Shake sniffs and shutters breath as he steps away with smile and hand grabbing the vial of Speed. 

,,Shake,'' says William as Williams steps. 

Guile chuckles feeling the joy rush through Shake at the act.

A farmer clicks and clack and pumps Minst's back as the farmer walks his sack to one pile of sack and drops the sack on to the pile. The farmer walk to the next pile and drags and slowly lowers a sack from the top of the other pile to the ground and slowly drags the sack over the ground to wheel and rope. 

Another famer ties and rope around the sack as th efarmer climbs down the wall.

The sack is lowered slow by the rope. 

Kirra steps toward the Rise between the road and the wagon. ,,I watch from Rise.'' She steps, ''Hear the boom from a far.''

Minst smiles. ,,I for once will be following Kirra's path and feel myself after for it.''

A hammar thunks.

Myst strikes her drum. 

A few famers around small fire clap and look over.

Myst smiles.

Spear steps. ,,Wizardry.'' 

Myst taps her drum twice each stike of the hammer to rod. 

Farmers around fires clap and slap. 

The ox-goblin beasts blusters and snort. Snot blows and steam billows.

Jan walks behind Kirra and stares over the drained swamp. Her feet feel to stick with each step from the road like bottoms of naked feet freeze to the pebbles. she feels a pull of energy from her body as she walks by the dying trees an vines reaching over the road edge and spreading through the pebbles over the road. 

Kirra looks a back at Jan.

Minst says rubbing his healed arm. ,,Is she cold?''

,,No,'' says Kirra.

Behind Jan's naked body, Flare feels Blue's force pull from Spear.

Spear walks with William, Myst and Guide between the wagons and ox-goblins beasts.

The drums taps and farmer claps and the thunks of hammer gives a beat to calm and hone the talk and warm. 

Guide and Shake walk and stand near the sacks stacked from the ground.

William glances at Shake and Guile as he walks toward the Rise.

Shake blows his nows. ,,Why you tell William?''

Guile pulls has cloak and hood over body. ,,To gain his trust.''

They stand and stare. 

Guile watches the farmers around the fire as Flare step and stands by the farmers. ,,It's poison.'' 

Flare walks to the farmer and claps with their clicks and clacks and laughter. 

The pack spreads and wanders along the caravan of wagons along the road.

Flare, Shake, Guides, Myst stand around the wagon broken wagon and ladders. William and Spear walk along the wagon looking at sleeping farmers, laying ox-goblins beasts, wagons stacked and covers.

,,I don't trust Guide,'' says William. ''I don't trust Blue.''

Spear walks a few steps. ,,I feel no lie or hate. I feel the time connected to Guide.''

,,Mystical, magical or a trick of Blue, I don't trust one once loyal to Blue and now feeling what he may have felt before.'' William looks back at Myst, Guide, Flare standing with the clapping and cliicking farmer warriors.

Spear steps letting feet fall hard. ,,I feel tension from you, my friend. Guide. Guide, can be sent away. Blue dones't care. How have you fared?''

,,I don't know.'' He glances at Myst. ''I don't know.''

Myst steps and walks in the light and stands by the fire for night with the farmers.

The farmers of hugoblins, human and hobgoblins standin thick weed woven coats and pants. Thick boots stomp and shuffle through the gravel. A small black pot steams from atop a bed of red coals.

Flare talks with the farmers and walks to the Set along the carvan to the last wagon.

Below the last wagon is the hole.

Guile and Shake walk along the roads edge and watch farmer-warriors carry bags into a hole then carry bags stacked a short walk into the swamp to carry them above.

Minst sees Guile and Shake as he glances back every few steps after touching the spine of his spell book. ,,Where are they at?'' He steps a few more steps. ''Why are we here?'' He steps and touches his spell book. ''Can I caste the spell to the hole?'' They step a few more steps. ''Where are we going?''

,,Rise,'' says Kirra. ''To the Rise.''

,,Yes,'' says Minst. ''I need to read a spell. I need to find components. I need to fly and caste a fireball.'' He smiles and steps and sits at the edge of the road letting feet hangover edge and eyes to read over the illuminating pages. 

Kirra walks past Minst and stops an arrow flight from Minst.

The carvan ends an arrow's flight from Kirra. 

Kirra stand and listens and walks to the road stepping by two sleeping ox-goblins sleeping with snorts.

Spear and William see Kirra walk from between two wagon to the light of torce and to the road dark. 

,,How long will we need to wait?'' says William.

The fires burn to coals and the coals dim from red to black. Wind blows.

The two sack pile near broken wagon rise snd fall with the pace of the drum beat tapped by Myst.

Myst's song of Reighn playes through the occasion thunk of hammer again nail and the continuous clap and click of hte farmer goblins around the fire. As the song plays, the notes translate to ticks not of song between the chorus.

There is laughter. And wind blows and gusts as the fire around the pot is snuffed by lack of fuel.

The song keeps them warm as they stand and wait for an event.

,,This is a boring wait,'' says Shake. ''How much time?''

Guile says, ,,A quarter night.'' Then lets his mind find the count of time and lose the count as he reaches deeper into Shake's mind. He finds as the song far players and as the calm of night stays the speed and haste of thought while Shake thinks of a play. 

Image flash past in poses and showers and a song repeates lyric like in ordered random rows to be mummbled by Shake with the song that plays. 

The night wind relents to passes calm breeze. 

The pack glances as the stand, stroll, peers and watch. 

Kirra peers through the dark from the rise come warriors marching in columns and rows.

Warriors wearing silver chain mail and white hide armor beneath the chain shirt and coil. They mach in waving rows as different paces.

Kirra whistlers and stand in the middle of the road.

Spear feel the warriors before they hear Kirra's whistle or see the flicker of the torches.

The soldier walk along the road near Kirra. Two warriors stands as the other soldiers walk past Kirra. 

Wide wagons pulled by four ox-goblins rools with solid wooden wheels over the gravel road slow. Tall stakes of grates and sacks sway with the wagons. 

As the caravan passes, its warriors spread and walk near the caravan stopped on road. Warriors walk near sleeping farmers and toss pebbles at their heads or kick a spray of pebbles on face. Warriors leading climb on the top of stalled wagons and look inside.

Spear and William walk the night. 

William hollers. ,,HOLD. YEILD. STAND DOWN.''

The warriors from the wagon train rolling past.

Though distant, Myst's song sings with William's talk and creates a song of clicks and clack flow with emotion from his mouth.

The warriors pull the trap from the top of the wagon while another thows down a sack.

Warriors walk past Williams and Spear look back.

A few farmer-warriors wake and roll and pull at the warriors.

A sword is drawn. Click and clack laughter attacks.

Kirr watches the warriors and caravan roll past and watches the warrios loot the wagons, walks between wagons and look along the road at Minst. She pulls bow from shoulders and pulls arrow from quiver as she walks to the Rise in the shadoews between the stopped caravan and the road.

Minst, lost in colors, shapes and sounds. A relief etchs circles around Minst in MInst's mind. He don't find the sound of two warriors stepping and reaching for his component bag. 

Kirra fires an arrows and strikes the warrior in the head. Then fires another arrow hitting the second warrior in the chest. 

A warrior pulling sacks from a caravan leaps down and hollers.

Minst reads through the relief and hte sounds. 

He reads through the shout of William and the roar of Spear.The warriors walking with the caravan watch Spear and William run past 

The warriors on the wagon leap down and scatter and away hidding through a group of soldiers walking wide across the road. 

The roar of Spear is heard by Guile and Shake.

Guile and Shake watch the night and the caravan pass. 

Shake mumbles, ,,Then the army rolls past not too fast, but slow like...'' He grips the vile of Speed.

Guile says, ,,No.''

Then the song of Reighn played by Myst stops.

The farmer-warriors singing out the fire grab spears and pitch forks peering at the warriors rolling ot the Set. They watch stacks of crates and sacks on wagons taller and wider roll by.

The warriors and twenty wagon caravan disappers into the night. 

Without fright or fear, Minst reads his spell book not seeing Kirra toss two hugoblins over the ledge. 

Kirra looks at the ground. No look outs are found.

William and Spear walk to her, and William says, ,,Shall we watch below.''

,,No,'' says Kirra. ''Why split the pack?''

And the pack stands, reads, watches, sings and sits. 

The bags are lowered by rope and wheel.

Bags are raise and stacked.

Three wagons roll past lead by ox-goblins and warriors wearing black leather body suits.

The thunk of hammer to U nails stops. 

The pack remains on watch.

Jan sits by the ladder feeling all the life and death through the swamp lost in the nature. A body of dust and water sits as the last sack from below is set above, and the last sack above is sent below. 

Minst closes his book, grips his components for fire and flight and stretches, peers to see Shake and Guile away.

Guile and Shake here whispers and clicks. Sihlouettes move and spread under the trees and from the sight.

A group chants and grunt as they push a lever to raise the broken wagon.

The ground pounds. 

Vibrations flow through the roads. 

Kirra, furthers from the rise, pulls bow and points arrow to the Rise.

The farmer warriors scatter from the smoldering fire bit and pots. They roll from under wagons and pull the robes tied around the necks of the ox-goblins.

The ground vibrates. A low moan spreads through the night.

,,Trolls,'' says William as he stops his march and looks to the Rise.

,,No,'' says Spear. 

Wagons jerk and shake. Low groans flow from the ox-goblins as the stand.

A few warrior farmers whipe the animals to action. 

From beginning to end the parked wagon caravan begins to move toward the rise.

To the Rise Kirra peers as the first wagon of the caravn rolls past. She lets the bow slack, lower.

The ground vibrates.

The vibration spread to Jan. It shakes her mind to find her body.

Jan wakes feeling a rage from the tree roots and plant vines. 

Another vibration shakes the group. 

Torch light burn below. 

Like snapped from a tance, Shake says, ,,Fire.''

,,Fire,'' says Guile. ''Fire. Fire.'' He pulls on Shake. ''We go. We  run.''

,,Run,'' says Shake.

,,Run!'' Guile steps, stumbles and runs to the Rise.

Torches light flares and glows below as the flames ignite.

Sword clash and goblinkin scream from the darkness below.  

The ground vibrates, and a boom pounds lowe through the night like a whisper from boom.

Spear hears the boom and Guile. He sees steps between two wagons, sees Guile and Shake running. He see a farmer-warrior cut the ladder and loss the wheel and rope over the ledge then run toward him and the rise. 

The wagons lerch and move. The wheels roll. Ox-gobln moos andclick and clack creating discorse through Myst's song.

Myst's song scatters as the farmer-warriors, the shouts from below clash with the ring of steal.

Guide grabs Minst. ,,Run.''

Shake screams as he passes Minst and Guide and Flare. ,,RUN!''

They run to the Rise toward Minst and Kirra.

Minst stands and looks around watching flames flare and burn, flame arrows shoot. Sihlouettes run between the light toward the rise. 

Boom blows over. Low bass squeek peiced the night following by the pop of crushed rock.

Kirra watches the pack run, and the cavavan wagon move.

Drum beats quick pace with the squeal of wood and steal. 

Glowing floating globes hover to the Rise.

The pack, farmer-warriors and caravn run and lurch forward.

Minst runs. 

A voice shouts, ,,BALL OF FIRE.''

Guile and Shake run past another carvan. 

An arrows shoot between wagons and before their eyes.

Flame arrows fire below the road on the swamp ground. Steel clashes steel, and wood thunks wood.

Minst pops components with fingers and tosses with arms circleing to back drawing a relief. The Shape of a funnels span. Minst spreads arms and flies above the trees and to the sky.

Kirra glances at Minst run between the caravan and end of road and slows to a stand. She stares at the flame arrows and clubs below.

The dark span to Jan as Jan run before Guile and Shake. Her feet feel to flake, and body blows to flakes by the wind and over the ground and with Blue.

Guide feels Blue and Spear and he runs to Spear, William and Flare.

Spear feels Blue through Guide. He hears the drums as he runs and says loud. ,,March drums.''

William nods. He slides sword to sheath and holds the hilt and scabbard as he runs and shouts, ,,STOP.''

Flare feels Spear's will for Flare to Speak. Flare speaks with the clicks and clacks over and over and over, ,,Thck jik, Thck jik, thck jik...''

The pack feels the drum beats.

Minst feels to fly through the sky then turns and dives to the ground.

The ground on the road is outlined with torch lights and floating globs. Flame arrows and clubs flicker through trees and spreads shot over the swamp near and far. Minst grips fireball components, peers along the road to the hole where the fire ball need blow. He glances to the pack below.

Through flashes of light, Jan runs flakes skin and body. Flakes sting Guile's eyes.

Guile breathes and coughs.

Shake says, ,,Why run?...Why...why...? What? ...What...''

,,Powder explodes,'' says Guilde.

William's and Flares talk explodes.

The drum beats slow and thump. 

The squeak of wood and steal slows. 

The hovering globes glow rows and columns of marching to a stand soldiers dressed in black chain mail and shiny red hide, boots and coifs. 

A sihlouette of a gigantic goblins as tall as three trees stands pushes and two tree trucks attached to a war wagon as big as a building. 
Archers on top of the level tall war wagon aim arrows at Kirra, Spear and William.

Hovering glowing globes float over Spear and William, Kirra.

The caravan of ox-goblins pushes, pulls, jerks moves fast over the road.

Flare clicks and clacks at a soldier wearing a black shash.

The soldier in the black sash hollers.

Minst dives, sees a club flare around GitThutFlikUmtStah stand by edge of raod and shout. ,,FIRE BALL BELOW!''

Minst pushes arms to side and files to a stand high above the trees, claps hands.

As Minst claps hands, Jan's feet step to dust, and she falls to ground.

As Minst claps hands, Myst's song silences.

As Minst claps hands, Spear peers at the at a cloaked hugoblin holding scepter on top of the war wagon.

As Minst claps hands, William stands and says waving arms along the carvan. ,,MOVE!''

As Minst claps hnads, Kirra steps between wagons and sees Jan fall to the ground.

As Minst claps hands, Guile breathes and Shake licks Speed.

As Minst claps hands, Guide runs to Spear.

As Minst claps hands, a fire clap explodes.
