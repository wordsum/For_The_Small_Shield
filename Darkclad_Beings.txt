Trees grow a forest and forest rises and falls as trees grow a forest.

Animals grow a pack and a clan rises adn falls as animals grow a pack.

Sun rises. Light shines.

Sun sets. Darks covers.

Jan moves through time standing still.

She feels the sediment pulled plants and pulled through the water weeds and over the snakes.

The cold water rages and spans and floods and receeds and bursts to a slow crawl from canyon and through the forest and the trees and the packs and clan.

The clan span from canyon open to canyon close by the beginning of the river flow. Through the life cycles they plant, fish and harvest season in cycles and ways through the trees and plants.

Plants die. They rot. They feed. They grow. Their roots spread and touch roots. The roots pull.

The pull grabs Jan's being and forces and spreads like roots through the sediment and dirt like water spreading through sand. 

Jan spreads and feels from plant to animal to the darkclad beings gathering cords and roots. She steps with each and feels the cold upon their bare feet and the dirt between their nails. She feels the tug and snap of plant from plant and the energy of all flowing like a fountain from the pulled root or coot.

See feels the sorrow of Myst and the delusional lust and want of Minst spread and poison. She feels William pound the ground with first. She feels Spear shout and raise. She feels Kirra's rage punch face of Wilber. She feels freeze then burn and Blue.

>,,LEAVE!''< is painful as a peircing ring and deafening as a banshie whail.

Jan blinks light on and off, on and off. Blinks open and eye sees Myst and Minst holding each other upon a cot. She sees Kirra's arrows spread and pack tossed. She sees the torn cot.

She feel and says, ,,I'm going to die.''
