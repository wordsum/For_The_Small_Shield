A pur spreads through Runtik's body then into her mind. The purr purrs.

A whisper voice sees. >We welcome you, Runtik.<

>You see into my mind, Ooooooolij< She feels through the Mind Trust laughter. Runtik steps through the darkness down spiral steps following the purr of the mind trust.

A gruff deep voice sees, >Runtik, have you failed to fulfill you contract.<

>No, Zankin, the Mind trust's contract is void for not including the possibilty of death.<

>Death is a contract with life. Life is you to contract. We contract a job.< sees a lower vibration mental voice.

Runtik walks down spirals stairs letting thoughts and the purr guide the body down. >Flilimilouminatom, the contract is my life.<

Runtik steps through the darkness down spiral steps following the purr of the mind trust.

Flilimilouminatom sees, >Why are you here?<

Runtik steps down stairs. >The silver hand i shuman. The army harrassed. The constables interviened. The constables talked with them through the White Wall. Runtik will not get name written in that log. Runtik seen a guard that may know Runtik.< 
 
Zankin sees, >Your contract was to guide them around Oasis with the help of Guile. You, Runtik, lead them to Shiptik. You have a contract. You complete the contract.<

Runtik steps down steps. >The contact doesn't mention saving silver hand from celestial and mystic spell casters.<

Ooooooolij sees, >where you followed. Ooooooolij feels no thoughts seeking mind. Ooooooolij reads of an event. Ooooooolij  feels your fear. What is Runtik hidding from the Mind Turst.<

>Runtik will show you the thoughts.< Runtik thinks the image of the fire burnt people running at them as zombies. She sees. >A fireball killed them. A cleric raised the dead to chase the silver hand.<

Flilimilouminatom sees. >You lived with the help of the cleric of Tone.<

>Myst is a cleric of Rieghn,< sees Runtik. >Another detail that may break the contract.< Runtik stesp down stairs.

>You not followed or seen,< sees Ooooooolij.

Runtik sees. >I was seen in the Rise of the outer city on buiding top. Constables wanted to talk. They probably wanted to write down name. I climbed the wall. I ran a roof top. I found a cart to take me around the city. My trace is hidden.< She steps from steps to a solid floor.

Darkness is denses and everywhere. Through the darkness, the sound of water flows.

Ooooooolij sees, >Why you return here? You contract with anohter?<

Then Flilimilouminatom sees, >This action not in contract. You know other silver hand. We will fail our mission if you continue to fail.<

Then Zankin sees, >You will leave and return to job or lose the return of hte contract.<

The voices echo and flow through the darkness of Runtik's mind.

Thorugh the darkness around Runtik's body, Runtik steps. 

The water like sound flows from Runtik's wane.

A breeze blows cold over here body. Sweat dries over body.
 
Runtik walks and  focuse on a small what dot before her body. In her mind she sees to all. >I arrive here because the silver hand and friends need proof or they will not follow.<

>you give them proof thorugh Guile with hte hive mind,< sees Flilimilouminatom.

Zankin sees, >You remind Guile if the contract. You remind Guile of the rewards.<

Runtik sees, >Guile feels let down with direction. Guile leads the doubt of me. Guile wants me dead. Others will want me dead unless I give them something they trust.<

Zankin sees, >You threaten him with the law and contract. Or you kill him.< 

Runtik steps. 

The white to dot spands and gows to a light shinning through a tunnel.  The light illuminates a walk way and a river.

Runtik stands. >Guile's mind for telepathy is strong than mine. The silver hand has powerful friends.< She breathes. >|I am here to get something, so they believe me with love.<

>You are failed,< says Ooooooolij. >We stop seeing. Stop the hivemind.<

>We have succeeded. They are alive because we forced them from the train. They have trust. They need proof. They silver hand and the cleric believe the quest to be one for their deity.<

Flilimilouminatom sees, >What of the muscled human and thin elf? We need them to help protect?<

Runtik sees, >They may convince the other's of a foolish quest if given a reason to believe.<

Flilimilouminatom sees, >The believe. You believe. Now go do!<

Runtik sees, >You verify for me. You get me in city. I get them. I get out. They live again. You give me something to show them I will help the silver hand with his holy quest.<

Zankin sees, >The contract has no requirement for additional help of proof. We have set the team. You have been contracted to guide the team. You will get the team from the city and to Tyrinium.<

Flilimilouminatom sees, >The silver hand is not expect to live. You create a lie.<

Runtik stands in the hall and steps toward the light. >The short stubby one reads the mind. The priest reads the soul. The warriors read the body.<

Flilimilouminatom sees, >We let them see with Love.<

Ooooooolij sees, >We can't expose ourselves more for the human silver hand. We give them no mind or person.<

Runtik sees, >We kill them.<

Zankin sees, >Your contract will be void.<

Runtik sees, >We know it will be void. We find this

A cold with blows through the tunnel and from the light.

The light shines over the round sand stone tunnel and loose sand. Five people sit and two people lay in the light.

Runtik steps to the light. She sits. She closes her eyes. She sees. >I need proof I am with the Mind Trust. Guile feels decieved because of you actions leaving Gnomsidy. The silver hand and the rest will seek the Rise.<

A purr flows through their minds and speaks as Love, >You need to leave before one notices the humans that survived Bin's wrath. You will be taken into the city by Ghhrend. You will give them their armor taken from them. You will guid them from the city. You will sleep. You will leave.<

Ooooooolij sees, >You see your plan to only you.<

Love sees, >Ghrend will guide you where they are located. We have found the silver hand. Now you sleep.<

The purr flows through minds. 

Runtik feels bliss and greatness (I need to show and flow to sleep.)

Runtik sleeps.
